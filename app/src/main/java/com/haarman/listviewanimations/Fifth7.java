                "Karma Yoga refers to the state of doing actions without getting too emotional about it. What happens if a good surgeon starts feeling too emotional for the patient - fearing for his/her life? Can he exercise good judgment in that case? How about a musician who starts thinking about his career in the middle of a performance? \n" +
