						 "In Chennai, once I was almost hit by bus when I was waiting on my bike at a signal on a nice, early morning. The signal was red, although no one was on the road. The bus behind me wanted to move ahead on the red, while I was standing on its way. Should I or should I not have obeyed that red light? Was I too dogmatic instead of pragmatic? Our poor technology (having red signal when the intersection is empty) has made a simple thing of following a rule into a dilemma. It has made rule-breaking the pragmatic option, instead of the other way around. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "One way to resolve such an issue is by having a better technology. If the signal detected motion in my side and not on other sides, it should directly change to green. That's what happens in developed countries. Use the right technology that makes rule-following pragmatic. When everyone around you realizes that the rule and its implementation is logical, there is less of a reason to break it (unless you are crazy). \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "This is just one simple example. We can have better technology throughout the society. Some more examples:\n" +
						 "Spend a few million rupees to design a very good website that has *all* the government forms used in all the government departments. The site has to be so intuitive that filling government forms should be a very simple and straightforward process. Make it very easy to get this accessible on mobile. If you do this well, you can eliminate the army of bribe seekers outside the government offices.\n" +
						 "Create videos and test materials to enable a prospective driver to learn the road rules in a simple, fun way. Every type of education can be made fun. Let them learn the rules, and the pass the test for *FREE* (without paying a bribe). Which Indian would not love things for free?\n" +
						 "Use analytics tools to analyze what the market prices of homes are. Most of the real estate black money involves understating the sale price. Once you build a strong analytics tool, it will be hard to understate price and save the tax. Same for sales tax and others. Share this data openly on the government website.\n" +
						 "Make credit card transactions more prevalent. Subsidize the payment technologies so much that people get incentives not to use cash. Cash transactions are the source of half the headache.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "These are starting points. There are a millions of things we could do as system designers. The goal of any society should be to make rule-following pragmatic. In India, many of the rules are illogical, outdated, archaic and stupid. This has made even logical people ignore the rules. Once the rational people start following the rules, the government can go brutal on the irrational rule-breakers. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Never have a meaningless rule that cannot be enforced well\n" +
						 "Any rule that cannot be enforced is tyranny & unfair. The good ones would be the only ones to follow them (due to self-conscience) and bad ones will not (no enforcement). An example of this is the prohibition law in the US in 1920s that made it illegal for people to buy alcohol. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Alcohol is so entrenched in the Western culture and so easy to manufacture that the laws were openly flouted. Crimes, gangs, mafias and corruption ruled in cities like Chicago due to that. India has many such rules that is similar. Alchohol is bad, but cannot be banned. Same for cigarattes, drugs, prostituition, transfats etc. If you cannot enforce a rule very well, don't have it in the rule book. By having these weak rules, you weaken the fear & respect for law. You then create these dirty surfaces over which germs then fester. Throw these unused furniture out of the window.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Simpler rules\n" +
						 "15 years ago, the cops near my home changed one of the key roads into a one-way. As a dogmatic rule-obeyer, I biked around that road for a long time, while no one else obeyed the rule. However, once someone told me why the rule was in place - to make it easy for a local filmstar to park easily - it no longer made sense for me to obey that rule. I broke that one-way rule as an act of civil disobedience. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "This happens all over India. There was a time when getting $$ was very hard. An honest relative of mine had to sell his Indian home and take his money back to Australia (he was a citizen there). When the Indian government blocked him from taking his own money out of India, what did he do? \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Many of our laws are stupid this way. We make it illegal for someone to be gay. We make it excruciatingly difficult for someone to open a new mine. We make it impossible for someone to open a new factory. Our rules are so bad that our entrepreneurs either have to look abroad for growth or bribe. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "When laws are stupid & complex, even honest people will ignore them. When an honest man is forced to break laws on a daily basis, the society decays. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "In 1992, Manmohan Singh destroyed gold smuggling business overnight. He didn't use big armies or police or courts. He just made it legal for honest people to bring gold into the country. Since early 2000s, Hawala has gone out of vogue among the good people due to RBI reforms. Never have an unnecessary rule in your book, that neither make sense nor can be enforced. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Simplify, simplify, simplify.\n" +
						 "Ad Hoc Revolution of 1991: Not just about careful planning but about Political & policy cleverness\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Reduce scarcity\n" +
						 "Ask your parents what it was like to get a phone line or a scooter in their time. Most people would have bribed someone to get these basic things. Now, you pay bribes neither to get a phone line nor to get a motorbike. You don't pay bribes to get ahead of the employment queue in employment exchange either. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Make it easy for honest and rational people to get their basic needs & desires satisfied in a straightforward way. There is a reason why all the nordic countries became so egalitarian and corruption-free (although brutal crimes were very common in the previous centuries). Prosperity is good!\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "The Movie - Guru - ends well on this idea. Ambani could have not broken the rules and not enrich the economy. Or he could break the rules and enrich the economy. Notable economist, Swami Iyer calls this the efficient corruption vs. inefficient corruption. Evolving out of inefficient corruption. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "In an ideal society, such a distinction should vanish and there should be no necessity for a good businessman to bribe. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Rule of Law -> Destroy a culture of fear\n" +
						 "This is the fundamental duty of the government. Setting up the rule of law so that the good guys are not afraid to talk the truth. That means anyone who threatens, hurts or murders a journalist, judge, government servant or a whistleblower must be treated mercilessly. Once you bring the murderers and gangs to justice with tailor-made laws & fast-track courts, the culture of fear disappears. Once good people stop being afraid, they will be more open to whistleblow. This is a classic law & order issue. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "On the flipside, governments should also stop scaring people with misuse of slander & libel laws. Anyone in public life should not be given the right to hide behind slander laws. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Reduce government involvement & destroy monopolies\n" +
						 "When governments are too involved in the economy, you create power-centers that become above the law. The government agencies become monopolies and laws would get written around them. You create these \"babus\" who become too powerful to impact your life. There is a concept called \"rent seeking\" where these powerful people will take \"rent\" for any economic activity you do (like selling vegetables on the road). \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Get rid of these babus and get rid of any kind of monopolies - government or private. When there are multiple companies vying to provide services to the people, corruption becomes less necessary. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "As you can see below, world's most corrupted countries have too much government involvement or run by oligarchs/autocratics. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Provide better wages to cops and other civil servants\n" +
						 "In most parts of India, cops get peanuts as official salary. This makes it impossible for a honest person to get in & survive. As the good apples exit, rotten apples replace them. As it is practically impossible to survive on the government salary, bribe-taking becomes a very simple and straightforward option.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Pay the cops well and be merciless when they take a bribe. When they are paid well, they have a lot to lose by breaking the rules.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Broken window theory - create clean zones\n" +
						 "In public policy, there is a concept called broken-window theory. In a street, if there are windows broken by miscreants and not acted upon, it sends signals to the other baddies that rule-enforcement is weak. Crimes will fester in those areas. In the same way, you tend to put garbage in those areas where there are already piles of garbage. You are less likely to throw garbage in a clean mall. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Like a lot of crimes, corruption is a disease - in that it can spread easily if there are not antibodies. To solve corruption, we need to create zones of \"cleanliness\" - where rules are both straightforward and enforced strong. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Government could start this in specific departments (let us say passport office) or specific areas (say North Delhi) and do a complete reset of the rules & enforcement. Make it impossible for anyone to break the small list of logical rules you set. Eradicate the disease in that zone, quarantine it and go to the next zones. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Working against corruption is a complex, long slog. It involves everything from building a strong economy to creating the right policies that makes sense. It is not a switch that you can turn on and off. Even if you have honest cops & leaders, you cannot solve it without fixing the underlying problems. Even if you give death sentence to bribe givers/takers, you cannot solve it. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "When we complain of attitudes, we are copping out and taking an easy way. Attitudes are a reflection of the environment and is an adaptation. That means, we need to change the environment and make it conducive to obey the rules. This will not eradicate corruption; like germs corruption will continue to live, but can be turned powerless. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "There is a famous dialogue in Kamal Hassan's movie - Indian/Hindustani. It goes into how bribes are present even in developed societies - but it is given to prevent the official from doing their duty. By the bad people. In India, bribes are necessary to get the official to even do their duty. Even by the good people.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Our focus should primarily be on how to prevent honest and rational people from bribing. This can be done by designing a better system. Once you get the honest people out of the corruption ring, you will get the strength of truth to fight the small fraction of real baddies."
