Of course, this is ludicrous and it would not work. Since they don't want to dig deep, they just assume that the British Raj was somehow honorable in not killing Mahatma Gandhi. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "There are 3  assumptions here:\n" +

						 "Gandhi was a naive activist whose method consisted of a mere protest\n" +

						 "British Raj was somehow honorable in tolerating Gandhi.\n" +

						 "Violent regimes just kill off leaders of non-violent struggle.\n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Governments usually don't kill top opponents\n" +

						 "Let us come to point 3. Ariel Sharon of Israel doesn't give a damn about world opinion and considered Yasser Arafat as vile and criminal. However, even Sharon never gave the final go for the assassination, despite having plenty of opportunity [1]. Even after the 1972 Munich Olympics when Israel was terribly angry and assassinated a whole bunch of Palestinians, they didn't touch Arafat. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "The Military dictators of Myanmar don't give a hoot about the world. But, they didn't kill the leader of peaceful resistance Aung Saung Suu Kyi. Even at the heights of his craziness, Mao didn't slit the throat of the Dalai Lama. Even when they completely ignored the world opinion, apartheid era South Africa didn't murder Mandela. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "I could keep adding 100s of examples, but suffice to say that governments usually avoid killing leading opponents because:\n" +

						 "There is an unwritten rule that leaders use to not assassinate the top rung of their opposition whether it is a foreign leader or a domestic leader of opposition.\n" +

						 "You never want to make a martyr out of someone and create a frenzy.\n" +

						 "Killing the top leader of a major group would bring a spell of anarchy that is almost impossible to contain. All leaders fear anarchy.\n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "In short, governments don't usually kill top leaders and British Raj was no different. They were by no means either peaceful or tolerant. \n" +

						 "Facts about Gandhi\n" +

						 "Fact 1: Gandhi was a very shrewd lawyer\n" +

						 "Gandhi was the son of the Chief Minister (Diwan) of a group of provinces in Gujarat. He was taught the art of ruling by his dad. He was sent to study in England when less than 10% could even read and write. He was called to the bar at the prestigious Inner Temple of London and was quite conversant with the legal systems UK, India and South Africa. He was no garden-variety protestor. He knew where to hit. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Fact 2: Gandhi often used frog in the water strategy\n" +

						 "Like a proverbial frog that gets cooked in hot water, a lot of Mahatma's opponents underestimated Mahatma's strengths in strategy and were defeated before they even realized who they were up against. Mahatma almost always got what he wanted. He missed his mark with the other Gujarati lawyer - Jinnah. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Fact 3: Mahatma understood economics very well and hit the Raj's economy\n" +

						 "At the end Britain left India, mainly because they ran out of money. It was no accident. India was their money spigot and it was the Mahatma who stamped their system and clogged their revenue pipe. Mahatma comes from the merchant class and married the daughter of a wealthy Kapadia family. He had very good relationship with businessmen throughout his life. He intimately knew how the economy worked. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "He first hit a ostensibly simple salt tax at Dandi. It was a masterstroke of brilliance. That was one of the stupidest tax and he made people understand the horror of British tax collection with that. Next step, he hit the core of British economy - textile mills. He dropped off his foreign clothes and made people to wear homespun Indian clothes. Pure brilliance.  In a few years, Britain could not longer collect enough tax in India, became practically bankrupt and started relying on the Americans. Again there, Gandhi influenced FDR enough to pressurize Britain through foreign policy. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Fact 4: Gandhi brought religion into the fore\n" +

						 "Gandhi quickly found that Indians cannot be aroused by anything other than religion. He was a master of spirituality. Christians were fond of his Christ like demeanor, while Hindus were drawn to the Gita. Many western preachers were openly in support of Gandhi, making life even hard for the Raj. Because, once you touch a religious leader, all hell will break loose. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Unlike others, Gandhi united India through religion and people from all walks of life from preachers in South Africa, pathans of Afghania, middle class women of England to Indian businessmen were attracted by the simplicity of the Mahatma's message. Through religion Gandhi brought public service reach every corner. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Put a rightful mastery of religion + legal expertise + communication skills + economics = Mahatma's strategy. That's the reason why Mahatma's struggled worked while many others didn't.\n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "The Mahatma was not a simple protestor who took a flag and marched. He knew where to hit, how to hit and when to hit. And he was supremely truthful and that act made his strategy a 1000 times more effective. The empire could not last as the Raj government underestimated him. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "Here is a pictorial representation of how Gandhi attacked the empire. \n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "\n" +

						 "SHARON IS SORRY ISRAEL DIDN'T KILL ARAFAT IN THE 80'S");
