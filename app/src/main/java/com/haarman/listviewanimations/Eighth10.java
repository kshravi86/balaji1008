It primarily involved the Navy, primarily involved islands and very little POWs involved.\n" +

Then 10 years later, it fought along with Russians & took over German territories in East Asia after WW-I. Then 20 years later, it aligned with the same Germans to fight the world. \n" +

In fact, had Hitler coordinated with Japan in attacking the Soviet Union and utilized the elite Japanese troops, the results of the Soviet campaign and the entire war could have been different.\n" +
