        textView.setText("I would not say majority, but many. Many Communists and Muslims are anti-Israel. The lower class doesn't care and the upper class will individually decide, whichever nation their business interests lie on. It is primarily the middle class Hindus who are pro-Israel. There are two parts here. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Why do Hindus like Jews [I don't think many non-Hindus in India support Israel].\n" +
                "Judaism has many similarities with Hinduism. Both are more of ethnicity/culture than religion. Thus, both have historically avoided proselytizing or conversions. Both faced trouble from much bigger organized religions.\n" +
                "Judaism was the first foreign religion to come into India and historically both religions found a harmonic coexistence as neither tried to convert the other. Hinduism is very friendly with any religion that doesn't threaten to grow at its expense. Thus, Zoroastrianism and Judaism are treated with utmost respect. History of the Jews in India\n" +
                "Jews are famous for their hardwork and schorliness and middle class Indians love those values. My dad always told me to study as hard as Jewish people whom he really respected for all the Nobels they won. The best way to gain the respect of an Indian middle class parent is to show that you are awesome in studies.\n" +
                "For some extremist Hindus, Jews are a friend because both the groups reportedly fight against Islamic extremism.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "[There are many Brahmin online communities that tout that they are second only to Jews in education and if you know Brahmins that is the rarest compliment one could ever get.] \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Why does India support Israel?\n" +
                "India has historically not supported Israel when a Nehru family member was around. Nehru was terribly against Israel and joined the Arabs in condemning the UN resolution. However, whenever a Nehru family member was not around Indian government made quick moves towards Israel. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Until 1990s thus India was quite anti-Israel. The first change came via the more pragmatic Narasimha Rao who wanted Israel's help in growing the economy and technology. Then, the Kargil war came that changed India's foreign policy. \n" +
                "During the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan, Israel helped India with defense technology and the ruling right wingers loved that. I remember reading a few news items in May 1998 that claimed that Israel was ready to strike Pakistan's nuclear facilities [before it went nuclear] if India gives a go and supports Israel in its conflicts. None of India's Arab friends came really forward to help India in a moment of crisis. India moved closer to both Israel and the US due to their help in ending the crisis. Paradigm shift after Israelâ€™s aid during Kargil\n" +
                "India is tech hungry and Israel has plenty of tech. For a poor country with a weak agricultural infrastructure, India has plenty to gain in terms of tech transfers and capital equipment sales. India and Israel bond with technology, innovation and A better potato for India, via Israeli tech\n" +
                "Israel sympathizes with India on Kashmir and India realizes that it cannot go too harsh on Israel as it would give more momentum to Kashmir extremists.\n" +
                "India historically feared Arab nations due to oil supplies and Indian workers there. However, as oil gets traded in global markets freely and Indian workers are more indispensable for Arab economies, Indian government no longer worries about those issues.\n" +
                "India hates Hamas. As the son of Hamas founder explains here, Hamas is not just against Israel, but wants to take a broader fight to a lot of other nations including India. That is scary. Even the Arab nations are very scared of Hamas and Egypt refuses to open its borders to Gaza. Gaza residents can expect more world sympathy if they keep out Hamas like West Bank does.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For now, India [and many Islamic nations] tries to keep this relationship quiet as it doesn't want to gain an undue attention and distract the foreign policy. \n" +
