Instead of a conventional reading list, I'm putting these books in pairs to help you get multiple perspectives on the same idea. It is all about gaining perspectives, not about storing a large number of words. \n" +

                "20,000 leagues under the sea & Around the world in 80 days: Both of these provide brilliant science fiction. Although many of the predictions are already a reality, Jules Verne is a must read for anyone with a curious mind. \n" +
                "A Passage to India & To kill a mockingbird : A good way to understand the British Raj and racism. Mockingbird provides an amazing story about justice and indignation.\n" +
                "War and Peace & Anna Karennina. If you are a strong reader, Tolstoy could be a great one. But, Russian novels can be quite hard on young teens if you are not used to the explosion of characters. \n" +
