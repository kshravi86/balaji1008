        textView.setText("This is quite a complex question. Mahatma had done something that no other human has ever done before him - unite a quarter of the world population (with extreme diversity) on a peace mission with no modern tools, heridatory authority or religious gospels. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Imagine you are fighting the world's most powerful empire that has every tool at its disposal. The empire considers your territory as its crown jewel and willing to do anything to fight for it. The empire could do brutal things (like shooting 100s of people gathered in a peaceful meeting) to quell any opposition.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "You have a dude who says he can win. Instead of asking you to pick stones, guns and bombs, he makes you create salt at a beach and sew your own clothes. The empire that was never afraid of the revolutionaries with bombs, starts to shake now seeing the protestors with salt and home made clothes. The empire watches its dismemberment helplessly as the dude carries out his mission in a completely unorthodox way.  \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Mahatma Gandhi was an uber cool leader who was willing to experiment crazy paths. He was predictably unpredictable. Some reasons why he was able to unite people.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He truly cared about people: Not just Indians. But, everyone. When the Mahatma announced the call to boycott British clothes (to rejuvenate the Indian economy & break the British monopoly) he took the time to visit the mills in Manchester & apologize to the workers. The British weavers never let him apologize and actually cheered his boycott. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Amazing background: By the time Mahatma Gandhi entered the Indian politics in 1914, he had already spent 21 years in the South African civil rights movement. He had the academic credibility from London and the street credibility from South Africa. Then he spent years touring India & observed from a very perceptive lens. Very few Indian leaders had that kind of background. Most were armchair revolutionaries (like what we are all doing now).\n" +
                "Extreme strength. He learned to balance on wooden logs placed over water when he was 77. At 77 we would all be getting done with our activities. And he grew up in the 19th century with no vaccination or modern medicine. His body was often devastated by constant fasting, protests, speeches and travel. His mind was traumatized by the violence and partition that was engulfing India. But, he had a task in hand - to stop a humouguous violence in a region of Bengal that was like this. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The villages were all isolated by river water and the jungles were infested with tigers and crocs. The villages were connected with each other just by small wooden poles.  At that age Gandhi learned to balance himself in the poles dug in Ganges to walk the river alone and meet angry villagers (who wanted Gandhi's blood) alone. He would live with them, reason with them and pray with them. Village by village, he calmed the religious riot. He saved millions and millions of people with that. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Patience to do the right thing: Mahatma combined the persistence of his character with the strength of adhering to truth. Most revolutionaries were willing to bend the truth & law. They believed that the ends justified the means. Mahatma didn't take any such shortcuts. He was willing to build his future brick-by-brick. He had immense patience. \n" +
                "Ideas that appealed universally: Mahatma's ideas moved the thinkers of Britain (Charlie Chaplin & Bernard Shaw) as well as the illiterates of Indian hinterland. In fact, I didn't watch the movie \"Gandi\" seriously until I was in a youth hostel in Utrecht, Netherlands where European students of all types were glued to the movie. There was something magical. Look at this awesome Italian ad: \n" +
                "The emotional appeal of a saint-politician: Mahatma's truth and character brought out the emotions in other humans. My grandfather is a very rational man who was a leader in the banking industry. But, when he got a chance to meet the Mahatma during his childhood, he was in tears. Businessmen, world leaders, judges, bankers, actors were all captivated by his charisma as they have seldom encountered a truthful politician. He was an absolute novelty (for a lawyer turned politician)\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Simplicity: There is an immense power in simplicity. Steve Jobs was greatly inspired by the Mahatma's simplicity (have you looked at his glasses). Mahatma kept the whole movement very simple and transparent. No one had to second guess. There were no secrets there. Watch this iconic Apple ad. \n" +
                "Self reliance: Gandhi simplified revolution to a DIY (Do it Yourself) sort of culture. He made people create salt in the coastal areas (British government had a monopoly over salt and charged an extraordinary tax on the basic commodity). He made people create their own clothes. He made people do very simple things as mark of protest. People were completely involved and enchanted. Other leaders talked, sermoned or threw stones. Gandhi redefined revolution. Watch this incredible scene from the movie, and look at what he did to Indians. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Used religion in a very unique way: Most political leaders either stay off the religion or use religion for divisive ends. Gandhi did neither. He actively used the religion to \"unite\". A lot of Christians were drawn by his \"Christ-like\" demeanor. Church leaders have been often with him during many of his struggles. He spent a lot of time saving the Muslims from religious riots & often walked to Muslim villages alone (at the time of brutal riots). He did all this while keeping a Hindu \"Bhagwat Gita\". Mahatma took religion to its very core - \"love and compassion\". Most religious practitioners often lose sight of this. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Grassroots: From the Day 1 until the end, Mahatma was at the grassroots. He had little interest in parliaments, assemblies, roundtables and bills. He traveled the trains, met people and bonded with the common man. Almost every corner in India was touched by the Mahatma. Although he was among the most important person in the world, he would usually be merged in the crowds. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, it was all about doing. He was a person who said what he thought, and did what he said. There was a complete harmony between thought, words and action. That by itself is a completely attractive proposition.\n" +
                "Gave up all the fruits of his hard work: You work 55 long years on a mission. The mission is now successful - India is finally free. Your life mission is satisfied and you are tired from all that work. Any other man would be basking. But, Gandhi was not celebrating. While whole India was watching Delhi and the exit of British, Gandhi was 1000s of miles away. He was in a corner, saving people from crime & violence. While other leaders cheered from the safety of Delhi, Gandhi was saving people in the slums. His mission was not done yet.");
