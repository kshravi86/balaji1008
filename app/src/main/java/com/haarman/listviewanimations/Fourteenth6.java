                "Why does US provide aid to Israel?\n" +
                "Managing Russian presence: It is not an accident that all the nations above that receive the most aid border Russian sphere of influence. Russia and and its allies (Iran and Syria) are deep into Middle East. To fight that, US arms Pakistan, Afghanistan, Israel, Ukraine, Turkey, Jordan... Israel is the most capable power in the region to fight back a possible Russian expansion and thus receives the most American aid. Russia on its part arms Hizbollah, Hamas and other anti-Israeli militants. Cold war is still on.  I will use an old map to illustrate this fact.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "However, these days Israel looks to build more relationship with Russia and that is not good for the US - it needs to pull its ally back with more candies. \n" +
                "Boost domestic defense industry: 75% of US aid to Israel is spent on buying equipment from the US. This is sort of like your car dealer providing auto loan. Also arming Israel, would pressure its opponents to buy more from the US.  US Senator Rand Paul set to visit Israel\n" +
                "Not sell stuff to China and other US rivals. Israel has got sophisticated tech that China, Venezuela and others covet. However, if Israel sells them US position will be at threat. Thus, US asks Israel not to sell a lot to China. US acts over Israeli arms sales to China. When you tell them not to, you better compensate them with something else.\n" +
                "Intelligence sharing & War on Terror. Mossad is among the top 5 most powerful intelligence agencies. US relies a lot on them to get access to crucial information to fight war on terror. Whether it is Iranian capture of American embassy or the Beirut bombing of US mission - Mossad was there to help. That help comes at a fee.\n" +
                "Arrow (Israeli missile) - US and Israel jointly develop an anti-ballistic missile defense system. 50% of it is paid by Israel and a lot of manpower is from Israel. This would be much more expensive for US to make without Israeli inputs and thus more than pays for US aid to Israel. \n" +
                "Military bases. US keeps 6 war reserve stocks in Israel. War reserve stock Israel is the safest place in the region to keep American missiles, bombers, equipment and hospital for the special forces.  Those help come for a rent.\n" +
                "Aid US in managing the trade routes: Israel's position is very critical for US to quickly react to any threats to US position in the middle east. Israeli guards repel Somali pirate attack on cruise ship\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Although draped in \"friendship\" and humanitarian assistanceship, US helps Israel primarily because, Israel is the best positioned to keep America's enemies out in the Middle East. Here is what Washington lawmakers put on Israel: [note the word \"asset\"]\n" +
                "Israel: A Strategic Asset for the United States\n");
