                "13 Centuries ago, when the Vedic religion of Hinduism was in decline, a smart man from the Arabian coast in present day Kerala, Adi Shankara, took India by storm. He organized Hinduism, simplified the religion through various interpretations of Vedas and most importantly setup religious missions (mutts) in 4 strategic corners of India. These bases would become the major centers of Hinduism.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "1200 years later, another guy from an Arabian sea town would do the same to the Indian politics, what Shankara did to Hinduism. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Gandhi's reentry\n" +
                "In 1915, when Gandhi reentered India after his successes in South Africa, India's freedom movement was slowing down. The charismatic nationalist Tilak and his rival Gokhale were retiring. The First World War that was raging on put a big clamp on political movements and Indians were relying on Britain's promise of self rule after the end of the war.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Gandhi took stock of this and started the movement as a social activism in a non-descripit village in Bihar, named Champaran. That activism to get the rights of farmers Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha defined his modus operandi. In the two years of social activism, he found 4 young men who would later shape India's destiny over 4 decades. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "These 4 cardinals - Nehru, Patel, Prasad and Rajaji - were brilliant men in their own regard, but became truly explosive under Gandhi's mentorship and tutelage. Like Shankara, Gandhi picked these 4 corners of India.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The Cardinals\n" +
                "Jawaharlal Nehru - aristocrat of the north, Nehru served as India's first Prime Minister and became the most important leader of independent India. India was primarily built on his vision. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Vallabhbhai Patel - the merchant of the west who forged India. Served as India's first Home Minister and brought the various unruly kingdoms into India. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) - the wily fox of the south, who was the first Indian to serve as the Governor General and first recipient of the Bharat Ratna. Managed Bengal expertly during partition as its governor, served as the bridge between Nehru and Patel & also took Patel's place as Home Minister after his death. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Rajendra Prasad - the scholar of the east, who became India's first President. He had a keen understanding of economics and was a Professor of Economics, before getting a Doctorate of Law. Headed the Constituent Assembly that created the Indian Constitution and helped resolve many disputes in writing the constitution.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In 1916, these were still young, trying to find their way to changing India's future. They found Gandhi fighting in the fields and immediately all the 4 left their promising careers to join the Mahatma. \n" +
                "Complementary strengths\n" +
                "The 4 men had something in common - like Gandhi they were upper caste Hindu lawyers. The big 3 - Gandhi, Patel and Nehru were educated in London, while Rajaji and Prasad were educated in India. This gave them some common ground to understand each other. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "However, they were also a diverse bunch. Nehru had the upper class charm & understood the aristocrats well. Mahatma Gandhi utilized his strength to build connections with other free countries. Nehru traveled around the world to bring foreign attention to India's struggle. Prasad was an academic who was well connected to the farmers who built the grassroots. Patel was well connected to the business men and with his keen sense of economics, brought India's rich men to the struggle. Rajaji was a well known administrator who rounded up the civil servants. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "In a political chessboard, Gandhi was the king. He didn't really play politics, but he was the key. Nehru had the agility of a queen, Patel had the strength of a rook, Rajaji had the tact of a knight and Prasad the bishop helped slice through the things smoothly. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Nehru had the raw youth (barely 26 during Champaran), Patel had the experience (41), Rajaji & Prasad were getting to their peak in their 30s. Gandhi was in his late 40s and needed these younger men. The 4 men were religious enough to comfort the Hindus, while being progressive [especially Nehru] enough to comfort the other religions. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Patel was a conservative both in religion and economics, while Nehru was his exact opposite - a liberal in both religion and economics. Rajaji was a right wing in economics, but not in religion. Prasad was a right wing in religion, but not in economics. The 4 rounded up the different political constituencies of India. Together they formed a mesh around the centrist Mahatma. [Eventually Mahatma also mentored Maulana Azad and Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan to round up the Muslim viewpoints]. Given his very smart moves, he was called pro-Muslim, pro-Hindu, pro-right, pro-left etc. Ultimately, he was all of the above.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "All these 4 proved very critical for Gandhi's success.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Nehru and Indira touring the West. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Rajaji was a key bridge between Nehru and Patel\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Prasad and Rajaji helped take Nehru's vision further.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Rajaji, Prasad and Patel with Netaji. Netaji was considered too young & too rash to fit comfortably into the Big 5. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "In our study of Mahtma's methods, we don't give enough attention to how the Mahatma picked his leaders and how deftly he created a base. Just as Shankara simplified Hinduism to reach the masses, Mahatma Gandhi simplified the freedom movement to get to the masses. They both strategically set their bases around the country and behind the veneer of calmness, there lay two extremely smart minds. Both of these Indian legends are poorly understood by present day Indians.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is sad that many Indians assume that some random old man with a stick started a protest and the Britishers ran away. He was the shrewdest political strategist ever.\n");
