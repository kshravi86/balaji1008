                "When people think of Mahatma Gandhi, somehow they think of a protester like this  - of someone carrying a banner, blocking the streets and raising a slogan. Of course, the stuff below doesn't work. But, that is not how Mahatma Gandhi operated.\n" +

                "This is NOT how Mahatma's methods worked\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In early 1900s, Mahatma Gandhi was faced with the greatest superpower- one who had colonized a big chunk of the world and one who had strong connections with another evolving superpower [US]. Unlike the French and Spanish, British were fairly tolerant and less interfering, but that also made them very potent. An ordinary Indian was not as motivated fighting the British who let the Indian carry on with their own religion and legal systems. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The British Raj was not as cruel as the other colonial empires, but that meant that protesting against it was hard [it is relatively easy to topple the cruel empires - as the suffering is more stark, the public gets pissed off quiet well and militant struggles have better momentum]. The capitalism with free press was a super potent enemy if you end up on the wrong side. Capitalism and free press meant that Britain was not as brittle as Spain, for instance, whose Latin American possessions crumbled in mid 19th century. \n" +

                "Key strengths of British style Capitalism\n" +
                "A supply chain that enable easy access to raw materials - India was a source of key raw materials for the empire - such as cotton, indigo and tea.\n" +
                "An effective process to generate and distribute capital - for the East India Company and later the British empire - India was a huge tax base. In the late 18th to early 19th centuries - large volumes of Indian tax were used to fight wars elsewhere.\n" +
                "Effective use of a large pool of labor - Indian workers were key to fighting England's wars, including both the World Wars, and also managing its plantations worldwide - from Jamaica to South Africa to Fiji.\n" +
                "Access to large and relatively free markets - India proved to be a large market for many British made goods - such as the textiles made in Manchester.\n" +
                "A free information flow supported by free press - capitalism relies on information flow [markets would crumble without knowing what is going on] and as a sidenote that is why most capitalistic nations are also democracies with free press.\n" +
                "Anyone who is fighting such a system has to dismember these key elements. Without hitting this core, capitalism is invincible. And who knows capitalism better than a merchant? That is where Mahatma the merchant enters the game. He took ownership of the freedom struggle from the priestly class that was mainly attacking it in an intellectual sense. British Raj needed a more powerful weapon.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Step 1: Dominate the communication channel. In democratic capitalism, one must own the information pathways [sidenote: this is how US continues to be the superpower]. Mahatma Gandhi lost no time in building a variety of newspapers. In South Africa, he started the Indian Opinion and in India he setup Young India and Harijan, among others. Mahatma was a prolific writer and a sharp journalist. His words reached Indians and diaspora very quickly. Mahatma Gandhi And Mass Media \n" +

                "\n" +
                "Step 2: Attack the raw materials. One of the first places, Mahatma started his struggle was in Champaran, an agricultural region in a remote corner of northern India. The farmers were forced to plant Indigo by the British administration and this resulted in a huge drop in food productions, leading to massive famines. Mahatma organized the farmers - Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha and slowly cut off the empire's access to raw materials. Champaran was widely popular and built Mahatma's core team of leaders [who would impact India for the next 5 decades]\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Step 3: Cut off access to labor. Mahatma was already popular with the India diaspora in South Africa and in India he focused on a labor problem a lot. He worked with the unions and often mediated between the workers and owners. With the Non-cooperation movement, Mahatma pulled out a big chunk of Indian workers off the economy.

                "\n" +
                "Step 4: Cut off the capital. At the core, capitalism relies on capital. What if the capital is blocked? This is the heart of the iconic Salt March - Mahatma using the simple salt to let the empire know that he can cut off Indian tax base any time. Although, Mahatma was immediately arrested like in all previous movements, the movement kept spreading. As the tax collections dwindled, the empire found it was too poor to hold on to India.

                "Step 5: Cut off the markets. Mahatma's most potent weapon is this wheel: \n" +
                "\n" +
                "With this wheel for spinning cotton, he taught Indians valuable lessons on dignity of labor, self-reliance and self-respect. For some, it was time for spiritual purification - Khadi and Gandhiji: looking beyond the fabric Like in the other avatars of Maha Vishnu, Mahatma made the chakra the ultimate weapon of truth. Most importantly, he cut off the Indian textile market for British manufacturers. Through this, the empire's economy was further weakened and made India a much less attractive colony to hold on to.

                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "By the middle of 1940s, Mahatma Gandhi made India a very unprofitable colony to hold on to, by attacking the key pillars of capitalism. Gandhiji was a capitalist throughout and always had great rapport with the capitalists and this enabled him to have a highly nuanced struggle. In short, he was no slogan raising protester. He was like a military general who stood up to the enemy's strength [both he an his enemy were very subtle in their methods] and was cutting off the enemy's strength in a methodical fashion. That's how he won.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Mahatma's strategies and methods were brilliant. Under the facade of a peaceful protester, lay the most brilliant strategist. The reason why others were not able to replicate his success is because they neither have the knowledge nor the skill set to put through this whole process.");
