        textView.setText("Hitler was an extraordinary speaker and had the ability to convince people that he could bring them out of their misery. 1920s was a period of extreme economic hardship for Germany and they could believe anyone who could be that convincing. The German people were disoriented by the World War - I as they could never imagine Germany losing. They badly sought answers for the defeat and one young lad convinced them that he had the answers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Even from a poor quality recording - we can get a sense of the immense hypnotic power of Hitler\n" +

                "The Rise of Hitler\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 1: World War I\n" +
                "Hitler had built up a status of \"war hero\" with an \"Iron Cross\" from his achievements in World War I. His rank was low, but his relative achievements were high. Thus, he reaped benefits from the war, unlike the higher level officers who got the blame for losing the war. Hitler got himself into a sweet spot and viewed favorably by the public.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 2: Beer Hall speeches\n" +
                "Following the War, Hitler went on speaking in beer halls. The drunk were his first audience. This is where he built his experience as a speaker. Put yourself in German shoes. You are hurt and ashamed by the first major defeat to your nation in over a century. You are hurt economically and psychologically. You are looking for answers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "There is this young lad, who did \"heroic\" things in the war and who has the answers. He talks of German pride and honor. He talks about whom to blame. And you are drunk. Would you believe in Hitler? Not unsurprisingly, Hitler got standing ovation.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 3: Mentoring and connections of Dietrich Eckart\n" +
                "Eckart was a famous German playwright who built up a German workers' party (later became the Nazi party). He was quite influential and connected. Eckart was also a member of an occult society that believed in the oncoming of a \"German messiah\" who will deliver. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "When he heard a beer hall speech by Hitler, Eckart was so mesmerized that he believed Hitler was \"the one\". Sort of like the Matrix movie. Since then, he offered all the connections, mentoring and organizational support Hitler wanted. Hitler got further coached in public speaking and received money from wealthy donors.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 4: Beer Hall Putsch - the failed coup and national publicity\n" +
                "With his strong reputation of public speaking, Hitler attracted a mass of people. And he attempted a coup in 1923. It was just a stupid thing where Hitler just marched into the Munich city hall and captured it. German police quickly hit back expectedly. The coup failed badly and he got thrown in the prison. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The publicity of the long trial, gave Hitler a nationwide recognition. During his time in jail, Hitler got the time to build his Nazi ideas and built a strong following. People started to believe in him and he got the reputation of a person who could make great sacrifice for Germany. This is where he wrote his influential autobiography - Mein Kampf. Although it was not that well read, it \"inspired\" the few Germans who read.  \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In short Hitler had acquired:\n" +
                "the reputation of a war hero + exceptional public speaking abilities + connections & funding through Eckart + publicity from the failed coup\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The perfect storm is about to blow.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "German economy of 1920s\n" +
                "The 1920s Germany was in suffering. The World War I and the punitive restrictions on them was suffocating the Germans. The economy was completely destroyed. Inflation was in the tens of thousands of percent. Money was so worthless that kids were playing with bundles of currency notes.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "German politics of 1920s\n" +
                "Germany didn't have a long history of democracy. Until 1919 it had an Emperor who was the head of the state. The nature of German society didn't put enough emphasis on democracy. A lot of people saw politicians and parties as irritants than an actual replacement to their emperor. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "A hodgepodge of socialists and right wing nationalists were running coalition politics through the 1920s. There were no strong political leaders to speak of. This random coalition imploded in 1930, leaving a power vacuum. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 5: German referendum, 1929\n" +
                "In 1929, the German nationalists pushed for a referendum (vote by the public) on whether Germany should continue to pay the penalties for the first World War. Although the referendum failed, Nazis got even more publicity by whipping up people's emotions (why pay money to France, when Germany herself is suffering).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 6: The rise to Chancellor\n" +
                "Germany system has a President with strong powers and a Reichstag with weak powers. The head of the Reichstag is the Chancellor.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Hitler first tried to become the President. In the Presidential elections of 1932, Hitler offered a viable alternative to the existing confusion. He fought strongly against the Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler won the strong support of German industrialists who thought the existing politicians were clueless about the economy. Hitler lost against Hindenberg, but came quite close (winning about 35% of the votes).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "After the defeat, Hitler started eyeing the chancellor. There were a number of contenders to the Chancellor of the Parliament, but none were quite strong. Hindenburg dissolved the Parliament twice in 1932. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "In the meanwhile, Hitler's supporters in the industry pressurized Hindenburg into appointing Hitler as a Chancellor citing the anarchy. After much reluctance and with no alternative, Hindenburg asked Hitler (a person who he despised greatly) to take up the role of a Chancellor (second in power to the President). \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Hitler is now close to getting an opportunity of a lifetime. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 7: Destroying the opposition\n" +
                "Although Hitler was a Chancellor, he didn't have as much power. The Communist party was still a threat. Then a key event happened. The Reichstag - German Parliament - was burned a few months after Hitler came to the power and the blame was assigned to the Communists. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Following the burning, President Hindenburg clamped down the Communists and repressive measures were taken on all other political parties. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Stage 8: Death of the President\n" +
                "In 1934 (within 2 years of Hitler's rise as Chancellor), President Hindenburg was dead (possibly due to natural reasons). Hitler took this opportunity to completely take over all powers of Germany. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Conclusion\n" +
                "In short, Hitler's rise was a calculated thing with a lot of steps to cross. At each point, he destroyed his opponents and got public to view him favorably.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Leaders don't get selected for the diplomas and work experiences during the tough times. It is actually a disadvantage to have high pedigree and conventional backgrounds in those periods. In tough times, people go for unconventional leaders as they believe that the conventional leaders failed to deliver. Thus, his lack of degrees and strong professional career was not an impediment.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " For instance, at the end of Vietnam war, oil crisis, Watergate and Iran refugee crisis in 1970s, US elected two unconventional leaders - Carter and Reagan - outsiders who were thought of as an antidote to the prevailing rot in politics.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Hitler had that precise advantage. He was an outsider and he was mesmerizing. People wanted to believe what he said was right. Although he was an Austrian, he was always impressed of Germany, fought for Germany and many Germans didn't realize he was an Austrian.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Timeline of Hitler's rise\n" +
                "1914-1918 - Various Iron Cross honors in army for heroic performance in WW-I\n" +
                "1920 - Joined the NSDAP (Nazi) party and got mentored by Eckart. Got connections, funding and speech training.\n" +
                "1923 - Failed coup that gave national level publicity. Wrote Mein Kampf in prison.\n" +
                "1929 - US Wall Street crash that started the Great Depression and destroyed the German economy. Nazis win their first win in a referendum held on whether Germany should continue to pay penalties to France.\n" +
                "1930 - Collapse of a grand coalition of right and left wing parties in Germany.\n" +
                "1932 - Hitler appointed the Chancellor as the President had no alternatives.\n" +
                "1933 - The Parliament set on fire and blame fell on the opposition. Repression of opponents of Nazis.\n" +
                "1934 - President Hindenburg died and Hitler took all the powers to himself.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "What is scary about Hitler is that his rise was neither that extraordinary nor that sudden. There was almost a natural progress and this is where the world must learn more about Hitler to prevent the rise of an another Hitler.\n");
