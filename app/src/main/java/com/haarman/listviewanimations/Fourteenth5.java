                "\n" +
                "1. Value of Education\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One of the reasons Jewish are such big achievers is because there is a huge value attached to education in their culture. Given their struggle with outside world for 2500 years, Jewish parents are strongly incentivized to provide the best of education to their kids.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In fact, Jews were among the first major groups to focus on literacy starting from the time of Christ. Botticini, M. and Eckstein, Z.: The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70-1492. This emphasis on education, gave them an early advantage and Jews quickly set up themselves in the first wave of globalization (during the period of Muslim Caliphates).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. Minorities everywhere => Existential crisis\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Jews were minorities in almost every land they lived (even in Israel their majority is dwindling). When you are a minority in a land, you have a strong incentive to work hard and prove yourselves. You can see this among various immigrant groups in the US (such as the Asian Americans), Zoroastrians in India (form the top tier in Indian society), Sri Lankan Tamils, Lebanese Mexicans and other small groups .\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Such a  minority receiving constant discrimination has one major objective: survive a hostile environment by proving successful. Thus, Jewish people (like the other minorities above) are more grounded, pragmatic and have a strong sense of community links.  Model minority\n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. Strong networking\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Minorities also tend to be strong networked. It becomes a sort of club if their population is not too big. Here the size of the club is important and big minorities (such as African Americans or Indian Muslims) are not able to utilize their minority status as much as these model minorities. In some senses, these networks are not different from the networks of Ivy Leagues. The community is connected by common challenges and bonded by historical links. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "4. Less influence of idiots\n" +
                "\n" +
                "When your population is that small and have a large level crisis, it is unlikely to form a large population of idiots. The idiot masses don't get their critical mass to significantly shape the direction of the community. Thus, Israelis have less things to be ashamed of even their ultra-cons. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "II. Why Israel is successful?\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Although Jews have a small majority in Israel, if you take the region as a whole they are a minority. Thus, most of the above points hold true even for Israel. Other than this, they have the following benefits.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "1. Constant external threat\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Israelis have to constantly be ready to face a war. Like an immune system receiving a vaccine and a muscle receiving workout, this kind of external stress keep their survival instincts to be always in play. No wonder they have a very powerful defense force.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. Immigration from the best of other countries\n" +
                "\n" +
                "When Israel was created in 1948, Jewish people from all over the world (from Russia to Austria to USA) came to the parched land. Many of these people held top positions in their society before the start of the war. Now, reduced to a pauper, these people started rebuilding their society. Unlike immigrants moving from poor countries, the Jewish immigrants had huge experience from their past leadership in business, science and arts. They brought the best of practices from all over the world.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. No resources paradox\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Israel has no major natural resource. The paradox of the Dutch disease means that, countries with low/no resources put far more emphasis on human development than the countries with abundant resources. The economy cannot rely on oil, mining or other traditional advantages. This affords them a weaker currency and a stronger government emphasis on economy. You can see this play in other resource-lacking places such as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "4. Packed in a small region\n" +
                "\n" +
                "You would think that a small size of the region is a disadvantage. Paradoxically, it is an advantage. When you pack a large number of smart people in a small region, intellectual sparks easily lead to the fire of innovation. This is especially true for economies relying on their human capital. Think Singapore or Hong Kong or Switzerland. Or major cities such as New York, London, Silicon Valley or historical Florence. In a small space, the smart minds of the region are brought close and get more focused. In a large land, you are often disconnected with the problems of people living 1000s of miles away.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "5 Power of the diaspora\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Give all the points at the start, Israelis have a very strong disapora force in US and Europe and that aids the state of Israel. Again this is not unusual. Diaspora from other countries (such as India) too try hard for their home nation, albeit with lesser force.");
