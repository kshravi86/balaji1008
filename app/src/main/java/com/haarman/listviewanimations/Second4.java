                "Provide opportunities to observe - bringing objects to class, field trips, art events etc. Manage this in a very effective manner rather than creating a laundry list.\n" +
                "Teach tools on the art of recording observations - journal entries, creating notes & mind maps\n" +

                "Teach basic logic and the art of experimentation. This includes understanding what hypothesis means and how those hypotheses are validated. Experimentation should not be just restricted to Chemistry, but for every stream of human endeavor.\n" +
                "Create ways to share experiences in a supportive way. It is very important to constantly share your experiences to grow your learning.\n" +
