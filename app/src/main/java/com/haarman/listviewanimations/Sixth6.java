When somebody cracked the proof for Fermat's Last Theorem, it was celebrated, but common people were totally unaffected. But, think about the battle between economic theories such as Keynesian Economics vs. Communism vs. Monetarism. The results of these can significantly affect everybody's wallets and purchasing power. Thus, power centers and vested interests interfere in economics more than any other field of knowledge. \n" +
