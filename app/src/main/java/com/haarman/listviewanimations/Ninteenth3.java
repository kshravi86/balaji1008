		textView.setText(  "Controlling the trade routes. Middle East lies in the critical route between Europe and Asia, through which a big chunk of world's oil and other goods passes through. US wants to control all the world's 7 key trading chokepoints below. The one who controls the routes, controls the \"gold\". Once you understand this point and see the map below, US foreign policy becomes clear. There is always a USS carrier group that moves around each of the 7 points.\n" +

						 "Largest market for US arms. Saudi Arabia is the world's fourth biggest buyer of weapons and spends annually $70 billion on military spending - lot of it going to buy toys from Lokheed, Raytheon, Boeing, etc. Saudi Arabia is world's fourth biggest military buyer. That is just one country. Now, add Oman, Egypt, Israel, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan... and you got a lot of dollars waiting to buy US arms. See, where all of UK's arms are going? That's where US is going too. Middle East bucks the trend on military spending\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Big spenders in infrastructure. Saudi Arabia and dozens of middle east countries are also a big market for American machinery, vehicles, airplanes, tractors, earthmovers, cranes.. you name it.  Saudi airline plans to buy 50 new aircraft\n" +
						 "Keep the Russians out. If US quits Middle East, someone would fill their shoes. That someone is a nation that has been eyeing Middle East for 500 years. It fought the Ottomans in a lot of battles to take control of the Middle East. Russia would have no problem selling to Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Syria or whatever. \n" +
						 "Military bases. Wars are won through military bases and alliances. The reason why US can fight wars anywhere in the world is because of its bases. A big chunk of its bases are in the Middle East. Here are some of the bases. These bases substantially extend the attack capability of the US military.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Help Israel. US has a \"love\" for Israel. But, that is a complex love. Jewish people vote Democrats and I don't see why Republicans should side Israel [a group the party historically hated]. There must be more than genuine love.  US needs Israel both for its research and also to gain leverage over the Arabs. In some sense, US uses Israel just has China uses North Korea - to keep the key trading partners in line. Israel is also a great partner in military tech. Why does the US provide so much foreign aid (roughly $2.5 billion per year) to Israel?\n" +
						 "Oil. Oil is a reason, but not in the way people assume. US imports from Saudi Arabia is the same is its imports from Venezuela+Mexico and no one sees the need for sending troops to the latter countries. Canada supplies to US 1.5x of entire Middle East. US imports < 10% of its consumption from the Middle East and can easily switch to other producers.   U.S. Total Crude Oil and Products Imports These days US gets enough of it from its own - North Dakota, Alaska and Texas. But, ME is essential to keep the price stability. More than the supplies, Saudi Arabia and its position in the OPEC ensures stability in global oil prices. That is key to American companies. Also, other world nations \"pay\" the US through \"soft\" currencies to have the US put its weight on the Saudis. Also, Oil supplies could be used as a chip against US enemies in a war. US could for instance cut China's oil supplies in an instant through its carriers in the region. China for its part, is trying to reduce risk by digging pipelines through Central Asia. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "The ongoing wars in ME affect the rivals of US more than the US. \n" +
						 "Unlike China, India, Germany, Korea and Japan, US has got plenty of oil of its own. Thus, any war in ME is more likely to hit the rivals before the US.\n" +
						 "ME is a big buyer of arms and when better to sell arms than during wars?\n" +
						 "Only nations in trouble and/or fear will let another country setup bases within their borders. US needs those bases. Thus, ....\n" +
						 "By playing the role of a godfather during crisis times, US gets to have a key say in their future. Saudis and other countries would keep running to papa when they are in trouble. When trouble stops, they don't need US that much anymore.\n" +
						 "In short, having troubles in ME is not a failure of US Foreign Policy. It helps US Foreign Policy, even if US is not deliberately creating trouble"
