        textView.setText("I'm not from Andhra Pradesh, although my cousins and I have lived in Costal Andhra when we were really young and I have a big family settled in Hyderabad for 7 decades. Thus, I might miss some of the important details. Feel free to comment. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is going to be mixed.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Bad\n" +
                "Education. Andhra Pradesh suffers the most as their people are already feeling the brunt of backlash in Hyderabad. Close to half of AP's engineering colleges, including the IIT, IIIT & BITS Hyderabad and NIT Warangal are in Telengana.  AP students have now lost their domicile status in most of them. For a few years there will be a backlash against their admissions. Until new colleges are built in AP, there will be pains for students & their careers. Especially for the Coastas, higher education is a very important issue.\n" +
                "Water. I'm from the Kaveri delta and I can tell you what happens if you are a victim of water disputes. The river that once supported the great civilization of Cholas is quite dry and a great region is blighted due to the water wars with Karnataka after the Madras state was divided in the 1950s. I hope the same doesn't happen to Krishna/Godhavari delta given that Telengana now controls the water. As Telengana develops more, dams will be built and water will start to get diverted out of the delta.\n" +
                "Emotional battles. As AP starts moving to their 4th capital since independence, emotions will run high. They have been made strangers in their own capital. Hopefully, GOI presses enough on the new Telegana government to treat all Indian citizens the same.\n" +
                "Finances. People from all parts of AP, put all their eggs in Hyderabad and making the city generate half of the undivided state's revenues.  Now, when they lose HYD there will be pains in state's finances that will curtail many development projects.\n" +
                "Power Shortage. Most of the power production is in Telangana, while a lot of the consumption is in the coasts. Thus, AP might face power shortages until the two states agree on some power trading. Right now, the central government is making sure AP gets uninterrupted power in the interim.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Good\n" +
                "Better governance. Small states have in general been good for India. The previous division of states (such as Punjab-Haryana, UP-Uttarakhand, Bihar-Jharkhand) have all been quite successful. Telangana would be able to prioritize its own issues (such as primary education and building an industrial base) while Andhra could aim for rapid development in the services & foods sector given that it has a lot of developed districts.\n" +
                "Telangana has an historic opportunity. Millions of Indian poor live in land locked states like Telangana. So far, their needs have been ignored. Now, they have water, engineering colleges, revenue base and thus no longer have an excuse to not develop.\n" +
                "Faster development. Telangana could now grow fast as they have got the resources. Andhra could go grow faster due to the desperation.\n" +
                "Well rounded development. People from all parts of AP invested too much in Hyderabad and too little in Guntur, Rajahmundry or Nellore. The painful lesson should make everyone in India realize the need for more rounded development instead of putting too much on our metros. Andhra people will move with a renewed vigor to develop a new capital along with 10 tier-2 cities and this will be good for everyone in India.\n" +
                "Moving on. For decades, the state was mired in clashes and disturbance. Now, that the division is done everyone can move back to development and focus on developing top-notch states. Without the Telangana region to hold them back, AP could move fast. In the same way, Telangana could assure more development in Nalgonda, Warangal and Karimnagar.  \n" +
                "Handling violence. AP would now be sparred of dealing with all the Naxals. Telangana could now make Naxals as top priority and deal with both peaceful & forceful terms. Some of the naxal problem is due a lack of rural development and this could partly be solved now. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Overall the lesson for India is not to concentrate too much power and revenue generation on a handful of cities. This lopsided development has made states war for key cities (Gujarat-Maharashtra for Mumbai, Tamil Nadu-Andhra for Chennai, Punjab-Haryana for Chandigarh and now for Hyderabad). If AP had 10 other equivalent cities, maybe they would not have been so vociferous nor would Telangana have been so eager");
