                "\"Take me to the center of the battlefield, Krishna. I'm curious to look at who is fighting on the side of the evil-minded Duryodhana,\" said Arjuna. The deafening war cry has come down.  \n" +

                "Lord Krishna acted as the unarmed charioteer of Arjuna. Lord Krishna was a neutral to both the fighting cousins and He split his armies from Himself. His armies were on the side of the Kauravas, while He Himself acted as the Chief counsel of Pandavas. The charioteer is a metaphor on multiple levels. \n" +

                "\"What will I achieve killing the people I love the most? What would I do with my victory after murdering all these people? I neither seek victory, nor the pleasures that come with that. I would not kill my teachers, uncles and friends for neither the heaven nor the earth,\" said Arjuna. \n" +

The Pandavas (of whom Arjuna is a part of) agreed to a split their ancestral kingdom to give half to their cousins, although the Pandavas were the rightful heirs to the whole Kuru kingdom. They built their own capital Indraprasta (modern day Delhi) and left their ancestral capital of Hasthinapura to their cousins. They thought having the separation would be an end to all this rivalry and jealousy of their cousins.\n" +

                "Through sheer cunningness even this territory was taken over by their enemies. The Pandavas were forced to play the game of dice, as refusing an invitation from their brothers would be considered hostility.  Yudhistra, the head of the brothers, then got addicted and bet his whole kingdom and his family. The dice was rigged and he lost it all and forced into exile for 13 years. The Pandavas had to spend the 13 years in forests and in anonymity \n" +
                "\n" +
                "After coming from exile, they were denied their throne even though they satisfied all the stipulations of the bet. Even then they didn't want to go into an open war and tried the route of diplomacy. They controlled the resentment at all the mistreating they received and still stayed calm - despite having all the powers to destroy their opponents. Yudhistra sent his diplomats to try and get a small part of their rightful land. These emissaries were insulted and thrown out by the Kauravas. The Lord Krishna Himself went to mediate peace and was insulted by the greedy Duryodhana.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "As the situation in their erstwhile territories were worsening, due to the rule under the wicked kings, Pandavas had no choice but to fight and establish the principles of justice. Although the Pandavas were good natured and reluctant to fight their cousins, the elders of the society adviced them that if they don't fight for their justice, future generations would stop believing in truth and righteousness. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Overcome by his emotions, Arjuna had forgotten all the background that led to this war, and his mind was clouded. Should he fight for justice or should he avoid bloodshed of his cousins? Is there a simple answer for this?\n" +
