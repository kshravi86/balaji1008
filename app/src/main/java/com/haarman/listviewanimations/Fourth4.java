In case of Kashmir, the Maharajah was greedy and wanted to stay independent of India and Pakistan. Within 2 months, Pakistan began attacking Kashmir to forcefully take over the independent territory. Pakistanis were quite close to taking over Srinagar. \n" +

Within hours India sent its army to Srinagar airport and started pushing back the Pakistanis. In the next 14 months, India fought Pakistanis to take back a chunk of Kashmir. \n" +

                "However, as the winter of 1948 started, we had only a little more energy to fight and Nehru made a controversial move of going to the United Nations and asking for their help to push out Pakistan. \n" +

                "UN asked for a ceasefire until the dispute is settled. India showed its legal rights given that Maharaja of Kashmir had agreed to join India. Pakistan contended that more than 50% of Kashmiris are Muslim and thus Kashmir should go to Pakistan. \n" +

                "In the 19th century, things started to change as Britishers both had the technology and the desire to pierce the natural border. Britain fought Opium wars with China and managed a puppet state in Tibet. Since then both India and China are trying to decide where their borders are. Since the extent of both these kingdoms varied over 5000 years, it is not really clear on who should own these disputed territory.\n" +
