        textView.setText("Almost all ancient civilizations are in various states of ruin. The Mayan civilization in Honduras is going through a major drug war, unable to keep even the kids safe. Rich and prosperous Inca and Mali Empires are now dirt poor. Egypt, Assyria (Syria), Carthage (Tunisia) and Persia (Iran) are a shadow of their past with weak politics and economy. Mongolia is practically forgotten and Afghanistan, a land known for art & culture, is under barbarians.\n" +

                "Greeks who led the Europe's economy is probably the weakest economic link in the EU and almost brought down EU 2 years ago. Romans who pioneered a lot in democracy has been electing Berlusconi and others. Turkey somewhat survives. Luckily, these three civilizations are amidst more successful economies and in a peaceful climate to at least have a relatively developed society. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "China, Aztecs (Mexico) and India are doing a bit better, but still a long way from their past glory and even 50 years ago looked hopelessly basketcases. \n" +

                "In short, Iraq's story is not unique. It is the story of all civilizations - they rise and fall. In the past few centuries they are in their down mode.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Why Iraq fell\n" +
                "Middle East is relatively flat and it is quite easy for people to move between Egypt, Turkey to the borders of India unhindered by major mountains or water bodies. This ease of movement was the region's historic strength and weakness. The region's strength came in the movement of ideas and goods. Also came the conquerers who found it very easy to move large armies in flatlands of the region. \n" +
                "Iraq, like Israel and Syria, lies at the crossroads of Europe, North Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. It was too strategic to be left alone. With no major natural barriers (like Sahara, Himalayas, Andes, Oceans), it was under constant invasions from all sides. The nation is flat as a pancake and the western desert is not too big to keep out anyone. Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Mongols and Ottomans have all invaded and ruled this region, lead to instability, destruction and a lack of cultural continuity.\n" +
                "Mongol invasion: During each age, Iraq would appear to reach a level of prosperity - Islamic Golden Age - until a new invader would reset the clock. In 1250, Baghad was the world's leading center of sciences, mathematics and art, until the Mongols ransacked. In fact, Iraq has not fully recovered from the brutality of the Mongols - Siege of Baghdad (1258). For a long time since then, they were ruled by outsiders.\n" +
                "Black death: In the 14th century, Black Death decimated most of Iraq and the population fell by more than third. The weakened civilization was then ransacked by the Central Asian invader Tamerlane (who also devastated Delhi) and the Ottomans.\n" +
                "Silt and salinity crisis: As mentioned in the other answer by Bimal Chandra Sinha, there was a salt and salinity crisis during 2000 BC, 1100 BC and 1200 AD. Iraq required a complex management of canals to prevent salt from depositing too much on the fields. During times of peace, good kings took good care of it. However, during periods of wars it was not looked after and thus agricultural crisis prevaded. Ancient Irrigation\n" +
                "Tribal civil wars: As the economy and science got trashed, people went backward to their ancient rivalries. From about the 15th century, tribal rivalries have been taking the country through a perpetual civil war. Iraq was the epicenter of the war between Sunnis and Shias and many other tribes. These tribes got there during different periods and have different loyalties and different external supporters.\n" +
                "First World War: In the first world war, Ottoman Turks who ruled Iraq sided Germany and thus Iraq ended up on the losing side. Britain and France just ran over the Middle East and sowed the seeds of many of the present problems.\n" +
                "European mess: When the French drove out the Syrian king, Britain got him to be their king of Iraq. Faisal I of Iraq. Think what would happen if an ousted king of China was made the king of Japan or India. Such stupidities were the cornerstone of the British mandate in the Middle East and it aroused tribal passions even more.\n" +
                "The wars: Various coups and revolutions followed Faisal's rule. Then Saddam Hussain took power. Economy started to grow and Iraq was a promising story in the Middle East Just when things looked positive around 1980, he went into a long, brutal war with Iran. During the war, he got a lot of loans from Kuwait to pay for weapons. Kuwait didn't accept to pardon the loans and thus Saddham invaded Kuwait. US and others intervened and Iraq was bombed to the stone ages.\n" +
                "Further wars: After the first gulf war, US pursued further attacks through economic sanctions and finally an invasion in 2003. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Summary: Due to its strategic position, Iraq was constantly invaded, plundered and still gets a lot of external interference. It has no natural boundaries to maintain a strong state and it has got multiple incompatible tribes as a result of centuries of invasions. \n" +
