On the other side fight the Kauravas lead by Duryodhana, who usurped the kingdom in a game of dice. \n" +

                "Dhritarashtra, the figurehead of the Kauravas is blind and hence is not at the battle. He is at the capital and is too anxious to know the results. Although he is good at heart, his mind is clouded by his affection towards his children. He is scared that his sons face the indomitable Pandavas assisted by Lord Krishna Himself.  Every major king in India is aligned to one side or the other, thus making it as one of the most monstrous the world has seen until then.\n" +

                "\"However, I don't know if we have the sufficient strength. Bhima's army looks more formidable than the army we have under Bhishma. Let us do everything possible to protect our General Bhishma,\" said Duryodhana. \n" +

As the war cry is heard by their opponents, they are met with a much more thundering war cry from the conch shells of Krishna and Arjuna. \n" +
