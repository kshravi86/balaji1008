Hitler considered Indians as Aryans, although not superior as the \"German Aryans\". In fact, those bastards took a lot of Hindu symbols (the Sanskrit term \"Arya\", the Swastika of Hinduism) and brought bad name to it. Nazi leaders often carried Bhagvad Gita (did the German translation of that time completely subvert the holy book?). \n" +

That kind of bluntness & strength impressed Hitler. No one else could do that and still meet face with the Fuhrer. Subhas Chandra Bose In Nazi Germany: Politics, Intelligence, and Propaganda");
