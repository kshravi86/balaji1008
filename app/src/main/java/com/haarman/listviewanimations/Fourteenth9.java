Shias place more importance on the people (Imams -- Shia means follower) and the Sunnis place more importance on the customs (Sunna). Essentially the question is, should the powers of Islam be vested with the hereditary authority or with the processes (roughly a sort of Monarchy vs. Democracy battle). \n" +

Britain took over Ottoman empire's territories in the Middle East and started imposing boundaries that didn't reflect the ground reality of various tribes. Mandatory Iraq.  Until 1914, the Ottomans had welded the various tribes of the Middleast into a federation. However, their defeat in the WW-I led the victors - UK and France to start splitting the regions among them.\n" +

Turkey didn't want Kurds to have a separate nation as they feared that a similar demand would be asked out of them (Turkey has a large Kurd population). US doesn't want a separate Shia Iraq as it would come under Iran's influence, nor want a separate Sunni Iraq that would come under Syria's domination. \n" +

Even the moderate Sunni tribes support the ISIS more than their own government - indication that Iraqi government is no legitimate representative of the people of Iraq. US should let the things take a logical course - tripartite division of Iraq. This will put down the ISIS in two ways - 1) they have no power to fight the Kurds or Shia militias in their home bases 2) once the Sunnis get their territory the moderate tribes would put more pressure on ISIS to reduce violence. \n" +
