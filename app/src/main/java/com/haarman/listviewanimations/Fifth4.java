                "Before we go into Krishna's response to Arjuna despondency, I will take you through an ancient Hindu folktale. \n" +
                "Sage Narada, the eternal companion of Vishnu, had the question of his life.\n" +
                "\"Who is the most ardent devotee of the Lord in the world?\" asked Narada. He was quite confident that the answer would be him. \n" +
                "The Lord pointed at a random peasant in a village. Narada was confused and aghast. He followed the peasant to his village and found the peasant's life unremarkable. The guy woke up in the morning, spent 5 minutes thanking God for yet another day, went about doing his work and then before going to bed he again spent 5 minutes thanking how the day went. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Narada went back to the Lord and angrily asked how come the 10 minute devotion of that peasant was stronger than the Sage's life long devotion to the Lord. Vishnu then took a cup full of oil, placed it on Narada's head and asked Narada to carry it past a slippery pathway along the river without spilling a single drop of oil.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Narada was totally focused on the task and was successful in carrying the cup without spilling. When Narada victoriously announced his entry, Lord asked him how often he spent thinking about Him while carrying the cup. Narada answered it in the negative saying how much the work required concentration. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Spending even a little time to ponder about life and being thankful about the beauty of life while carrying about all the everyday duties properly, like the peasant did was worthier than thinking all day about the Lord. In short, it is doing one's duties spotlessly, constantly thinking of improving, while having a overall perspective about life is the winner. \n" +
                "\"Since when has his cowardice stuck you? This behavior is disgraceful for your intellect? Your dejection is unworthy for a person of your stature,\" said Krishna. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Yield not to impotence, Arjuna. You are a scorcher of your foes and have won many a historic battle. This cowardice doesn't befit you. Stand up and take your guard.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"How shall I fight my own cousins, relatives, friends and teachers? If I kill them, will I be able to enjoy the pleasures of the victory? What is there to enjoy in the world without them, \" said Arjuna.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"My heart is overtaken with pity. I'm confused. Take me as your disciple and help me handle this dilemma. I'm taking refuge in you.\"\n" +

                "\n" +
                "\"You have grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Neither I nor any of the rulers you see here would cease to exist hereafter. While these bodies die, the souls never die.  Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does he pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "That firm man whom surely these afflict not, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality! The unreal hath no being; there is no non-being of the Real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Know that to be indestructible, by whom all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.These bodies of the embodied Self, which is eternal, indestructible and\n" +
                "immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others that are new.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The Self is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, you should not grieve. \"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Krishna starts with one of the core elements of Hinduism - the presence of the indestructible self. The \"firm man\" does his duties without grieving a lot about death or about our impermanence. The fear of death can be a constant distraction to our duties.\n" +
