                "                                  -- Dalai Lama at the  Nobel Acceptance Lecture (1989)\n" +

                "Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation.\n" +
                "                 -- Martin Luther King Jr at the Nobel Acceptance Lecture (1964)\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Gandhi is more relevant than ever. In the 21st century, the abundance of terrorist movements mean that the world is both tired of the cycle of violence and will refuse to listen to anyone with arms. That means any movement that takes up violence will be considered bad in the world's eyes. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "There are 3 key elements of Gandhian philosophy:\n" +
                "Satyagraha - Always, fight for truth, no matter what.\n" +
                "Ahimsa - Be nonviolent in your fight. Let your mouth and deeds do the fighting.\n" +
                "Sarvodaya - Upliftment of everyone - all classes, all castes, all religions, all regions, all sexes.\n" +
                "These are all very relevant in the 21st century. But, peaceful protests don't work in most places, right? The problem is that there are very few leaders of moral repute and patience who could utilize the tools of the Satyagraha. This is where we need better leadership who can use Gandhian tools. Gandhi was also a super intelligent politician who knew how to move people. Most modern Gandhians don't have those abilities and are resigned to small movements. But, there are a few in the recent past. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Nelson Mandela did all these three and helped build bridges between blacks and whites in South Africa. He didn't let his country go in the way of Zimbabwe. At the same time, he made sure apartheid was gone. Martin Luther King Jr did the same in the US and became an inspiration for blacks and whites alike. Unlike the leaders of the black power movement, he is also respected outside the black community and outside the US. He used the same principles of the Mahatma. Recently, East Timor won its independence mostly through peaceful means. Wangari Maathai of Kenya used some of Gandhian ideals. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Some of the other principles of Mahatma is also very relevant now:\n" +
                "Lower carbon signature & Sustainable development - Gandhian movement emphasized on simplicity and anti-materialism. Escalating costs of energy and other resources will make some of this mandatory in 21st century.\n" +
                "Distributed organizations - Gandhi emphasized on a highly decentralized organization that coordinate in a manner of trust and truth. This could be applied both in politics and economics. India's Panchayati raj is one such example of this principle.\n" +
                "Do it yourself - Gandhi made his clothes by himself. His goal was to impress upon people that no job is lowly. We can get on to this DIY culture and start building some of the stuff we use.\n" +
                "India's National Innovation Foundation speaks of \"Gandhian Engineering\" - of producing sustainable things that are simple to use and have a meaning & purpose. 'Gandhian engineering' vital for 21st century'\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Few lessons we can learn from the Mahatma:\n" +
                "When you are pursuing the path of truth, patience is utmost key. Most movements descend into anarchy or fizzle out.\n" +
                "Following the path of morality. During the course of his mortal battle, the Mahatma had to take a few tough decisions - like calling off the Non Cooperation movement when it seemed the anarchy would send off the British in no time.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Will Gandhian ideas solve all of world's problems? No. Nothing will. Each problem needs its own customized solution. But, Gandhian principles can be utilized as a core block in a different solutions.  \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Here is what one of the architects of India's opening up said recently:\n" +
                "While the twenty-first century has been defined by globalization, free markets, privatization, liberalization… it has also been marked by violence, extremism, inequity, poverty, and disparity. Amidst all this, if one poses the question of relevance of Gandhiji to our age, one is struck by an astounding need for him for our times. Gandhiji's ideals… and leadership hold an extremely relevant moral and social mirror to our society.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "                                                                                     -- Sam Pitroda\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth\n" +
                "                                                                                 -- Albert Einstein (1939)\n");
