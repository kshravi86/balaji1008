                "    Inflation. This is how much your money turns less worthy. 30 years ago our parents could buy cars at a fraction of what we pay now. Why is inflation important? In the previous case, if your parents had one kid and you have one kid, how much did your family grow to. Actually your family tree has shrunk. To enable your family to grow bigger, you need to have more than 2 kids. That minimum is inflation when it comes to money. If your investment makes less than inflation, you are actually shrinking.\n" +
                "    Time value of money. Every language has a proverb for the equivalent of \"A bird in hand is worth two in a bush\". Money had today is always more valuable than the same money had tomorrow. This is why you get an interest when you lend someone money.\n" +
