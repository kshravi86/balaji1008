                "While I read 100+ pages of text a day, I was able to finish only 2 books in the past 6 months. The 5-volumes of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" that my wife gifted for my birthday still sits in the shelf untouched. In the past, I would have been able to finish it quite easy.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "To be sure, our reading is not going down. Just our long reading has gone down. Think of it as the difference between running 1-mile a day for 26 days and running a marathon.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In short, preparing to read a book is like working out for the marathon. The whole world would conspire against you in reading and test your stamina.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Here is a simple strategy:\n" +
                "Start with comics like Asterix and Tintin. Asterix is among the greatest comic books ever and can entertain for life. I read the entire series once every year. Asterix can be finished in 2 hours and thus can prepare you for the long slog to come.\n" +
                "Take some of the smaller novels. Animal Farm is a good one - it is short enough, but still has quite deep concepts. Who Moved my Cheese is even shorter, but with deeper ideas. Take something meaningful - life is too short to spend with trash.\n" +
                "Take more entertaining novels 150+ pages long. This is going to pain you if you are not used to sitting a whole day reading one book. Agatha Christie wrote a series of very entertaining detective stories that are both simple and entertaining. Michael Crichton is longer, but entertaining sci-fi.\n" +

                "Here are some of my other favorites for beginners: What books does Balaji Viswanathan tell 16-20 year olds to read? Eventually start playing around with Virginia Wolf, EM Forrester etc. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "How to read a book effectively:\n" +
                "Take a physical book, ideally hardbound, from your local book store. Don't take digital readers to start out with. They are not made for beginners.\n" +
                "Find a calm place where no one will disturb you for hours. Throw out your phone, laptop and all electronic nuisances.\n" +
                "Develop a connection with the book. Imagine you are courting someone on a date. Start flirting with the book. Enjoy the outer cover. Smell the paper. Read through the author bio. Read the blurb. A real book lover literally falls into love with his/her favorite books. Better the bond, better the chances are you will stay through reading the whole thing.\n" +
                "Read, re-read, and re-re-read the first few pages. The first few pages are often the hardest. Good novels will drop you into a new world while keeping you blindfolded. You will be stunned and confused. You will feel like you have been abducted. You might feel disoriented. It will take a while to make sense. Don't feel the panic. It happens to everyone.\n" +
                "Bond with the main character. Start becoming a buddy of the main character. You are going to be his/her partner for a while and you better know more about that guy. Pay much more attention to the descriptions about that person. Hope that he/she is going to take you through a good chunk of the book. Remember the key events involving that person.\n" +
                "Breeze through the tougher sections. After the first 10 pages, you can feel more comfortable. Sometimes there are long passages that won't make any sense. Feel free to skip a couple of pages. If you are lost, you can also come back. If the book is that good, you can always take a second serving.\n" +
                "Start day dreaming. After a few chapters, you will start playing things on your mind. You might start building castles in the air. You might feel like dancing on your way to work.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Welcome to the world of books!");
