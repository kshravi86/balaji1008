                "Resources argument: The ones who worked hard to get into a top program are more likely to utilize the resources of the labs, libraries and professors than the \"weak\" student. By admitting only the weak students, you potentially cause resource wastage.\n" +

If you are recruiting someone for your national football team, you are going to look at only two things - skillsets and efforts put. It would be unfair to recruit a guy just because his dad was poor.\n" +

This is why governments strive for universal and equal education at the school level. By the time someone comes to the University level he/she already should have the momentum to go and seek the higher truth. Good professors primarily have the skill of guiding you on your path, when you have already started seeking the path. Universities have not been traditionally designed to create something out of nothing.\n" +
