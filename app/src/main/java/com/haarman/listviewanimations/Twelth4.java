        textView.setText("Gandhi and Sachin offer very interesting comparisons. The are the heroes of most Indians, but these two are chased by a vocal minority that they are \"overrated\" - whatever that term might mean. They not just ardent Hindus who got married young [and to older women], their solid marriages were defining backdrops of their careers. They were religious, but never let their religion divide their followers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Both are India's loved heroes who are as appreciated abroad as at home. But, both have very brutal haters who will go any extent to tarnish their images. At the same time, both have very fanatic worshippers who will not let any constructive criticism be passed either.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sachin and Gandhi have their admirers in Pakistan even when they played the game for India. Both made very strong mark in England [and with many fans there] in which they started they actually started their careers after a brief start in the subcontinent.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Their final victories\n" +
                "\n" +
                "I'm always saddened when people think Mahatma Gandhi's biggest contribution was ending the British rule. It is a bit like saying Sachin Tendulkar's greatest contribution was winning the 2011 World Cup. Sure the victory is good, but their careers were far beyond that final trophies.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sachin Tendulkar took Indian Cricket through the hopelessness of the 1990s. The masses would switch on the TV just to watch Sachin bat and switch off once he was gone. He was our only hope. He was the only one who could carry our dreams. And his greatest innings were not the world cup victories but came far and beyond - in places like Perth, Chennai and Sharjah.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In the same way, the freedom from Britain in 1947 was like India's 2011 WC victory [in both cases we were filled with despair in the immediate post-victory era]. Gandhi played a huge part, but his greatest innings were in places like Kheda, Champaran and Dandi. Like Gandhi, Sachin had to see the horror of his team imploding after such a momentous victory and retire in that gloom [none of this demeans the lives of so many that were lost around partition].\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Comparison with other leaders\n" +
                "\n" +
                "When Mahatma Gandhi arrived in Indian political scene Congress was the Indian team of early 1990s. Many retiring legends - Tilak, Gokhale, Beasant - dotted the scene and the national movement lost the wind, just as the Indian Cricket team in the early 1990s was trying to come to grips with retirements of Kapil Dev, Shastri, Srikanth, Vengsarkar etc. Gandhi snatched leadership from Jinnah, like Sachin from Azharuddin and were Jinnah/Azhar India's heroes or villains is something we could debate forever.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A whole new era beckoned both. Gandhi built a new team - with players doting him - Nehru, Rajaji, Prasad and Patel. Just as a new team was growing around Sachin - Ganguly, Dravid, Kumble and Laxman. These guys will see through the end of that era. Nehru as flamboyant as Ganguly [maybe chacha might not throw off his shirt in the Lords like dada], Rajaji as straight as Dravid - impeccable, low key and under appreciated, Prasad as wily as Kumble and Patel was like Laxman facing the Aussie team. None could match Laxman when he gets on like what he did in Eden Gardens [2001], just as none could match what Patel did in Junagadh or Hyderabad.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Their parallel careers\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sachin started slow in his international career, but early in his career he produced a number of interesting innings that showed his mettle.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Just as Sachin, Gandhi's international career started a little slow, but picked up steam in no time in South Africa.  Just like Sachin, it was Gandhi's overseas victories that caught the attention of India's leaders at home. Like Sachin, Gandhi received a rousing reception in India and never looked back.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Within a shortwhile people realized, he was the \"one\" by Gavaskar and Vengsarkar, especially after the overseas tours in England and Australia, just as the Mahatma was recognized as the \"one\" by Gokhale, Tagore and other doyens.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In that period, both produce some scintillating innings even when they didn't directly change team victories. In 1998 Sachin was in his song - with unbelievable innings in Sharjah and Chepauk. Gandhi was in his song in 1918 - with unbelievable innings in Kheda and Champaran. Just as the like test victories that don't contribute to World Cups, Gandhi was winning the real tests - wiping farmers tears in Champaran and factor worker's tears in Kheda. Those are among his best contributions.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The big fall & the comeback\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sachin started his 1999 with promise, but that promise bombed due to injuries, just as Gandhi's promising phase faced their biggest challenge in 1919-20 with failures in Khilafat and Non-cooperation movements.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In the despairing years, both men rediscovered their innings. Great men are defined by the quality to bounce back. That is why Steve Jobs is so idolized in business. It is the comeback that defines.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sachin produced a fascinating performance in the 2003 world cup with a darling innings against Shoaib's Pakistan, just as Gandhi produced a darling innings in the Dandi march of 1930. In both cases, we were short of the \"Purna Swaraj\" or complete victory. Both energized the masses.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Both Sachin and Gandhi are examples of what India can produce - non-fanatic decent gentlemen who can scale great heights without being assholes. They both reflect the brilliant diversity of India in their followers. They combine grass, class and simplicity with flamboyance, character and brilliance. Both are icons not just of India, but of the world.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "They helped the nation walk through hopeless nights - the poor workers would come home to their squalid lives hoping Sachin would provide that painkiller to end their hard day, just as the poor would wait endlessly to catch a glimpse of the Mahatma passing in the train through their village.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Their careers cannot be measured in cups & victories, but in the hope they offered to a billion people. They made India look in the mirror and be happy with herself.");
