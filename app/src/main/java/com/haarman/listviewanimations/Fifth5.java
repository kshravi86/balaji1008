                "\"The Self is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, you should not grieve\", said Krishna. Arjuna is still not convinced and still quite confused. After all, don't all ancient texts speak of love and not killing? How can fighting be congruent with that?\n" +
                "In both real and fictional world, the tension between emotions of love and emotions of justice is very common. We want to do something good for the world, while still not hurting our close kith and family. When close members of the family are standing in the way of truth, what should we do? This sort of dilemma is faced by leaders all over the world. \n" +

                "\n" +
                "Krishna gives a framework for managing those situations. He tries to calm Arjuna's mind by explaining about the soul & why one should not grieve too much for these personal losses, while trying to show him the broader perspective. Not fighting the war would kill a lot more people in the way of misgovernance. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "At that stage, Arjuna tries to become someone else - an ascetic or a monk - while Krishna very well knows that Arjuna's characteristics will not let him be anything other than a warrior. Let me tell you an ancient Chinese folktale. \n" +
                "There was a poor sculpter Zuan in a county called Zhouzhi. He resented his hard life, sitting in the sun and doing grunt work for the royals. He prayed everyday. After a long hard prayer, one day a fairy came.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Zuan asked to become the ultimate master who couldn't have anyone dictating terms to him. The fairy gave him a magic wand that will make him whomever he imagines to be.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Zuan got the magic wand and imagined to be the emperor of Xi'an. He has now become the emperor of Xian and starts having a happy life. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "One day, he went on a hunting trip to a distant forest. There he was captured by a group of cannibals who captured him and took him to the tribal chieftain. Before the chieftain could order to kill him, he used the magic wand to become the chieftain as he felt the chieftain was more powerful than even a king. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "He had a good life as a chieftain, until a regional warlord started harassing him. The warlord kept demanding more and more taxes. Zuan used his magic wand again and became the warlord.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "His life as a warlord looked good until a day he was struck in massive storm. The rain ransacked his troops and he was left stuck in the devastating storm with nowhere to hide. Zuan imagined to become the cloud that caused the storm (as that was more powerful than the warlord).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Zuan now transformed into a cloud and started wandering around free. Then hit up on a big mountain and couldn't move further. He then desired to be the rock that could stop even the clouds. Zuan now felt really strong as he was the rock that made the big mountain. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "On a hot sunny day, there were a big group of sculptors who came searching for nice rocks to carve. They started using the tools against the big rock of Zuan. As the rock started crumbling, Zuan imagined himself to be a sculptor. He became the sculptor once again. \n" +

                "\"Further, having regard to your own duty, you should not waver, for there is nothing higher for a warrior than a righteous war. Happy are the Kshatriyas (warriors), O Arjuna, who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven!\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"But, if you will not fight in this righteous war, then, having abandoned your duty and fame, you shall incur sin.\"\n" +

                "Krishna is referring to one's duty and this point gets even more enforced in the coming chapters. If an army soldier at the border suddenly has a change of heart and stops fighting the enemy, he would create more social disturbance than calmness. Imagine the life of a baby is at stake and the cop refuses to use force. Will that lead to a better social outcome or a worser social outcome?\n" +
                "\n" +
                "While there is a time and place to profess peace, a person whose sworn duty is to protect cannot ignore that duty easily. Mahabharata has two terms related to truth.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Satya - This stands for truth and honesty at the individual level. You don't lie, kill, speak ill and follow all kinds of traditional morals.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Dharma - This stands for eternal truth and sustainability. Traditional morals for individuals should not stand in the way of a solider protecting the border or a king protecting is kingdom from vicious enemies.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Dharma, represented as a Chakra/circle is common to all Indian religions and stresses the need to think of sustainable human life. To sustain human life, sometimes the rules related to not-lying and not-killing need to be broken.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For kings and warriors, the laws of Dharma should supercede the laws of Satya - if they ever collide. \n" +

                "\"The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be above these three attributes, O Arjuna! Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of Sattwa (goodness), freed from the thought of acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self,\" said Krishna.\n" +

                "\"When your intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then you shall attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard. When your intellect, perplexed by what you have heard, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then you shall attain Self-realisation.\"\n" +
