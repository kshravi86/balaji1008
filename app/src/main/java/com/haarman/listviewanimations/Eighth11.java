			"There were only 3 possibilities in the war:\n" +

			"1. Avoid warring Japan and start protracted discussions.\n" +

			"2. Capturing Japan through conventional means.\n" +

			"3. Forcing Japan to surrender with Atom bomb.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"1. Why not conventional weapons? Now, those of you who say that US should have invaded Japan with conventional weapons forget that US has not had a successful invasion in Asia. In Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan or Iraq, US found itself mired in incredible complexity when they tried the conventional route. If you cannot win Vietnam in 1970s, there is very little chance you could have won the much stronger & committed Japanese of 1940s in the middle of the Pacific. And all the previous encounters with the Japanese (in Iwo Jima and elsewhere) suggested that they were not going to give up easily. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"Also, the US had been repeatedly bombing Tokyo without significantly weakening the Japanese resolve. Civilians died in millions but they didn't give up. Thus, the US needed something supremely psychological and an invincible weapon that would break the Japanese heart. The Atom bomb gave that psychological overpower. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"You don't want to just win, but you want to make the enemy completely hopeless and give up their battle. That was the only way to win Imperial Japan. Here is a link to the debate in Japan that talks the impact of the bomb on the Emperor and how it contributed to the surrender. History News Network\n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"2. Why not throw it in water and just threaten them? This option wouldn't have worked because there were only a couple of nuclear warheads back then and the US didn't want to lose them and lose their leverage/option. The nuclear weapons of 1945 are substantially smaller compared to the thermonuclear weapons we have now. Thus, throwing the warhead in the water might not have threatened them in a big way. Also, Japanese leaders would be even more convinced that US doesn't have the guts to use such an heartless weapon. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"(The 2 nuclear weapons used)\n" +

			"\n" +

			"3. Why not drag the war and peacefully end it? Millions of innocent civilians were dying in the war every year. It is not just Americans - everybody in the world wants the war to end soon. There was simply too big of a human price to pay for lengthening the war. In 1943 alone, 4 million Indians perished as the war cut off their food supplies. Thus, war had to be stopped immediately. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"Even if America had imposed a naval blockade, millions of Japanese would have died as they were dependent on the rest of the world for food, energy and basic essentials.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"The decision factors:\n" +

			"Almost all major researches suggested that the death toll in the top two approaches would be greater than the 300K death toll of the last choice. So, by utilitarian moralistic principles it was thoroughly justified. It was essentially a Sophie's choice. There were three main benefits to the nuclear bomb dropping in the Japan vs. Humanity battle:\n" +

			"It immediately stopped the war. It was quite likely that the war could   have dragged on for months or even years in negotiations and direct attacks without the n-bomb. Japan was killing Asian civilians at an average rate of 100K every month. So, even if the nuclear bomb had cut short the war by 2 months, Asia was way better off. \n" +

			"Even if Japan had surrendered in a conventional attack, they would have continued to fight back after a few years of recouping. It required a massive calamity to stop a naturally warring Japanese to completely reshape their fundamental ethos.\n" +

			"The gruesomeness of the n-bomb told people how brutal nuclear power could be. Without that lesson, somebody else would have attempted it in another war with greater repercussions. The event also helped put  greater emphasis on non-proliferation.\n" +

			"Although the above sounds cold, the whole war was anything but human. For instance, the Operation Meetinghouse bombing in Tokyo killed more than the Nagasaki bombing. Bombing of Tokyo - So, I can only talk relative to the alternatives that the allies had.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"4. Soviet Angle - There has been a few research that shows the Soviet angle was important too. Soviets have finally decided to end their neutrality with the Japanese, and declared war 4 days before the surrender. However, this war declaration came after the US dropped the a-bombs, and thus none would know what its real impact would have been. Also, a Soviet occupation was significantly terrible compared to the a-bombs (as east Germans would say).\n" +

			"\n" +

			"-----------------------------------------\n" +

			"It is naive to assume that only the atomic bomb was done over civilians.  Almost the entire World War - II was fought over civilians. Most of the  destruction was borne by the civilians of every side. Thus, given a choice I would always sympathize with the innocent civilians of Philippines and China, than those of the aggressor nations including Japan, the Soviet Union and Great Britain. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"In fact, Japan eventually suffered a lot less than Germany. The Bomb swiftly brought the surrender and Japan was back on track in a decade. Germany intensely suffered division & had far more civilian causalities when Russian tanks rolled into East Germany.\n" +

			"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n" +

			"Western PoV ignores Asia\n" +

			"The western point of view sees the bombing merely involving potential  American & Japanese casualties. But, the persons who were really  affected by Japanese actions were the Asians and the Asian POV is often ignored. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"How many people know that:\n" +

			"Chinese lost over 10 million people directly and indirectly due to Japanese invasion\n" +

			"Japan tested anthrax, plague and other biological weapons on Chinese civilians? Doctors of Depravity \n" +

			"India lost 4 million people in Bengal famine of 1943 that was directly as a result of Japanese invasion of Burma: Bengal famine of 1943\n" +

			"Northeast Indians bravely fought Japanese in Kohima at a turning point event in the \"Stalingrad of East\" Read more: Battle of Kohima? This was only 12 months before the dropping of the n-bomb. Without that Japan would have been in India.\n" +

			"Japanese soldiers engaged in wide levels of cannibalism: Japanese war crimes\n" +

			"Andamans (Indian islands) were occupied by Japanese and suffered in a brutal occupation. \n" +

			"Burmese Indians came in droves as refugees to escape Burma occupation: Japanese occupation of Burma\n" +

			"Japanese aggression in Asia caused 10 million+ deaths, cannibalism, biological experimentation, inhuman beheadings and mass massacres. Japanese war crimes\n" +

			"\n" +

			"The Indian story\n" +

			"My great grandfather gave up all his belongings and property in Burma just  to escape the hyper-brutality of Japanese. Their stories are simply  horrifying to make Nazis look like school teachers. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"We Indians were very lucky that Japanese were stopped in our borders by  really brave British & Indian warriors in Kohima. But, the few territories they took were evidence of their brutality. I have been to the Indian islands of Andamans and the island bears stories of the Japanese action. Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands It was quite chilling to imagine what would have happened had they entered the highly populated mainland India.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"The Chinese story is even more chilling. Battle of Changde and Nanking Massacre\n" +

			"\n" +

			"(An Australian PoW beheaded by a Japanese soldier)\n" +

			"\n" +

			"\n" +

			"(A complete ditch of bodies in China)\n" +

			"\n" +

			"The nuclear bomb drop on Japan was justified if you consider what the Japanese did to Asia and what it would have taken them to withdraw from rest of Asia. Unlike the Germans who have accepted the Holocaust now, the  Japanese don't even apologize and still celebrate their war criminals.  Thus, it is very likely that they would have continued a long fight.  Without American intervention the following list could have substantially grown.\n" +

			"Alexandra Hospital massacre\n" +

			"Banka Island massacre\n" +

			"Changjiao massacre\n" +

			"Kalagong massacre\n" +

			"Laha massacre\n" +

			"Manila massacre\n" +

			"Nanking Massacre (terrifying one)\n" +

			"Palawan Massacre\n" +

			"Pantingan River Massacre\n" +

			"Parit Sulong Massacre\n" +

			"Sook Ching massacre\n" +

			"Tol Plantation massacre\n" +

			"Wake Island massacre\n" +

			"Summary:\n" +

			"1. When it comes to WWII, the Yankees had the biggest moral weight among the participants as it was not their war anyway. Although they were not saints, they still helped end the biggest war within 3 years of their entry. After the war they helped rebuild both Japan and Europe with the Marshall plan and others.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"2. The Japanese were highly unpredictable (Pearl Harbor) and determined (Iwo Jima), and nobody wanted to take chances. No one knows how long World War 2 would have lasted without the atom bombs. Dragging on a war would have been brutal for all participants. \n" +

			"\n" +

			"3. When thinking about Imperial Japan, don't confuse them with the present day Japanese - the leaders in world peace. The Japanese at that time were so hardened that they never even revolted against the emperor even when they knew about the tyranny. They all stood silent while their leaders raped and plundered their neighbors. And you know what is nemesis. Sooner or later, even the civilians had to pay a price for their silence in the face of injustice.\n" +

			"\n" +

			"4. Wars always present us with Sophie's choice. The decisions that the leaders have to make are always grey and take a more colder/realistic view of things. If you lose 100K lives by action A, vs. losing 200K lives due to not taking action A, you choose action A. \n" +
