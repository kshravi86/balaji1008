                "    Most of what is taught in a good college are not easily available online. I had 30+ full courses for my MBA and I have not found anywhere online that matches that level of depth. Most of that content is locked away in the professors heads or available through very expensive Harvard cases. Yeah, I could read \"Personal MBA\" book in a day. But, the comparison is between a lake and the water glass you have in your hand.\n" +
                "    How do you stay motivated? 90%+ of people who take up self education never finish. Colleges on the other hand are like machines that will push you in and out.\n" +
                "    Evaluation. How do you know that you have acquired sufficient knowledge? Where do you stand among your peers? This can be very hard to get in books and online education.\n" +
                "    A lot of your knowledge is from your peers. Those 30 or 40 people in your class form bonds with you that will help you professionally and personally. While Coursera has some study groups for some courses, it is not fully prevalent yet. And in books, there is nothing. \n" +
