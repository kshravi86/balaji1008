That detail might not mean nothing to you, but if you have read Jules Verne's Twenty thousand leagues under the sea you can understand why they named it that way. Hamlet and other Shakespeare works will be very casually used even in very mature non-fiction works in the English speaking world. In India, Ramayana and Mahabharata will be used extensively. \n" +

For instance, it is far more easy to remember Mahabharata than the 100+ non-fiction works needed to explain the same level of concepts. \n" +

I work in a very \"boring\" field of security and legal compliance, dealing with the world's largest corporations. However, I make my product concepts into stories and send it out as cartoon strips. Customers are much more receptive to these stories & are more inclined to comment and respond to ideas. Reading fiction, helps us create better story lines.\n" +
