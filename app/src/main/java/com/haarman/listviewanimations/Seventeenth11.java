						 "Study hard. Education and the degrees are the ticket to riches.\n" +

						 "Stick with your peer group. Don't do something wacky.\n" +

						 "Stay off politics and any other kind of trouble. If you must enter politics, stay off the core.\n" +

						 "Neither commit crime nor be the one to clean it up. Act as though you are no way related to crimes around you. \n" +

						 "</End-Cynicism>.\n" +

						 "Middle classes are very important to a society. They are stable and keep the society wobble less. They help businesses scale by being workers and managers. They tend to commit very low crimes and are great for governments."   );
