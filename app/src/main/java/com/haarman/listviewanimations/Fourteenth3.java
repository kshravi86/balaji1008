                "Crossroads: Israel/Palestine lies in the ancient crossroads of human civilizations - strategically located close to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Iraq and Syria. It was a key area through which humans moved for tens of thousands of years. [Palestine is a geographical term first used by the Egyptians, while Israel is a cultural term used by the Jews to refer to specific tribes].\n" +
                "Invasions: Since it lay in a strategic hotspot, invaders from every direction overran the area - Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Assyrians [Syria], Persians [Iran], Babylonians [Iraq], Arabs, Central Europeans, Mongols, Turks and the British. Each one left their own cultural imprint on the region.\n" +
                "Emigration: Due to invasions and natural causes, many natives of the people moved all over the world and many others moved in after each new wave.\n" +
                "Return: Throughout history, the exiled natives always wanted to return back to their own land. For instance, 3500 years ago an Egyptian guy named Moses brought back the Israelis living in Egypt back to their land. He was celebrated as a prophet for bringing people back. Another such event was about 2500 years ago, this time due to a Persian guy named Cyrus - Return to Zion. In short, natives were getting in and then thrown out back again. Game of cat and mouse.\n" +
                "Christianity and Islam: Around 2000 years ago, a Palestine guy named Yeshua brought new religious ideas and this led to the Split of early Christianity and Judaism. The Romans eventually followed his ideas, while many natives didn't and thus Romans started their persecution of the natives. The native Jewish people constantly revolted and thus kicked out. Around the 7th century, Islam came to the region and an Arabic caliph named Umar helped Jews resettle back. The process also increasingly brought the Arabic culture of the region.\n" +
                "Crusades: The period of moderate Islamic rule over the region ended, when the Christians were back through Crusades to take back the land of their Father Jesus Christ. For centuries, the war was fought and Jews were caught in the middle between Christians and Muslims. At the end of the crusades period, Muslims got hardened and a brutal Mamluk dynasty took power.\n" +
                "Under the Ottomon Turks: In the 16th century, a Portuguese guy named Joseph Nasi convinced the moderate Ottomons to give them a small territory to settle the Jews in Tiberias. Many from Ukraine and Russia started settling after the brutal Khmelnytsky Uprising. But in the 18th century Near East earthquakes of 1759 destroyed Tiberias and other cities destroying stability and creating emigration.\n" +
                "Failed siege of the French: In 1799 a French guy named Napoleon asked the Jews in Europe and Africa to invade and recapture Israel - Siege of Acre (1799). He was quite friendly to Jews and the latter thought their time had come. But, the French lost the siege and the Jews got even more hated by the British and the Ottomans.\n" +
                "Migration from Eastern Europe: In 1881, a Russian Tzar named Alexander II was assassinated and the blame fell on the Jews. Persecution once again. In the meanwhile, the Ottomans holding Palestine were getting weakened. Thus, for the nth time, Jews began their migration back. First Aliyah\n" +
                "End of First World War: In 1917, the Ottomans were completely defeated in world war and their territories were taken. Like dozens of kings mentioned above, Britain promised a national home for the Jews through the Balfour Declaration. This was to be a trade - Britain would help create a united Arab state and there will be a small Jewish state in Palestine. In return, Britain would get the help of both to fight their global wars.\n" +
                "The partition: At the end of WW2, Britian had no more patience in playing games among multiple religions. By 1947, the number of Jews had dramatically increased due to decades of migrations through various Aliyahs. There needed to be a partition. 3 months following the partition of India on religious lines, in 1947 Britain proposed a partition of their territory of Palestine into a Muslim one and a Jewish one. Arabs were given a big chunk of the important territories, while the Jews got the southern desert and the Red sea coast. Following a very similar template as India's partition United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The 1948 war: The Arab nations didn't agree to it and 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine started. The war ended with a victory for Jews. The Jewish state of Israel not only took their own granted territory, but also the territory assigned to the Palestinians. They justified it as \"conquest by war\" - an accepted historical means to add territory. Many Jewish people from all over the world returned back to the region. The pains of Holocaust was one of the many reasons for this.\n" +
                "Oslo Accords: Like it happened throughout history, war broke out for the control of the lands. About 5 major wars were fought in all. In all the wars Israel won the battle against the wars and kept extending its territory at the cost of its neighbors [such as Golan heights, Sinai peninsula]. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "However, it also faced increasing violence. In 1990s, both sides finally turned to the table, where the Palestinians agreed to the legitimacy of Israel and Israel in return offered to quit regions like the Gaza strip that was assigned to the Palestinians as per the 1947 partition. Israel also returned Sinai to Egypt and negotiations were on the Golan Heights.\n" +
                "Free Gaza: As per the Oslo accords, Israel exited Gaza. In the Palestinian legislative election of 2006, the militant party Hamas won.  Hamas doesn't recognize Oslo accords and want to end Israel. Israel sees the group as a terrorist organization. Thus, both groups constantly fight in a tit-for-tat confrontation.\n" +
                "Rocket attacks: Both Hamas and Israel attack each other with rockets whenever they find an \"injustice\". In the confrontation of June 2014, 3 Israeli students were kidnapped & killed causing a new round of rocket exchange between the two countries. Why did Israel and Hamas go to war in July 2014? and Timeline of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Summary: The region's central location between different civilizations meant massive invasions and migrations throughout history. Different groups claim ownership over the land through their historic association. One such group, a descendant of an ancient native tribe, rules Israel. Another descendant of an ancient tribe rules \"Palestine\". Both sides want more land, citing history and keep fighting. ");
