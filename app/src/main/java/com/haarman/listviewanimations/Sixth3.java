His food expenses stay the same Rs.5000 [only one stomach to fill], but he now spends on a new home loan, an expensive art work for the hall, vacation in Europe and much better gadgets. \n" +

As he moves higher in life, food becomes vanishingly small % of his salary. All his other needs multiply, but stomach's needs stay the same. \n" +

Almost all of our time goes into hunting & gathering food. As we settle into a civilization, food production explodes, leaving us a lot of time to spend on arts, architecture, clothes and fun. Eventually, we build nice homes, great roads & airports, travel more, have better entertainment options. \n" +
