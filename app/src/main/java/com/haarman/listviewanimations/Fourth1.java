                "West always looked Pakistan more favorably than India even before this war. In fact, since 80s India was complaining about Mujahideen and OBL, while US was still training these baddies. In India, there is always a resentment that US media and establishment give Pakistan far more coverage than it deserves. Although the recent economic growth changed things a bit, when it comes to geopolitics US is still clueless in South Asia (and no wonder America's Afghan campaigns are failing).\n" +
                "India doesn't share a border with Afghanistan (in our maps it shows a small shared border, but the that border has been under Pakistan's control for decades). Afghanistan is landlocked and that rules out ships. That means, India has to depend on its arch enemy Pakistan's airspace to deliver aid to Afghanistan. This makes the delivery of a lot of essential things from India harder and contributions less noticeable than they should be.\n");
