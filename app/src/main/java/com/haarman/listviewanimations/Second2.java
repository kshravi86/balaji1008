                "The college where I studied my undergrad is in a poor region. Being a government funded institution it is primarily populated by students from abject poor conditions. Poverty you cannot imagine. [I once accidentally broke the plastic plate of my roommate and he was so sullen.  I never knew a Rs.10 plastic plate for eating was unaffordable for a few. Still he refused to take my offer of buying him a new plate.] If not for the government, many of them would not be even able to buy a bicycle. Barely a few feet away from my window in the Comp Sci class, farmers would be tilling their dry lands with oxen.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One of the roommates in hostel is among the poorest of the poor. His father was a coal miner and his remote rural hamlet didn't even have a pincode and house didn't have a number either. His father probably earned about Rs. 800 per month ($0.40/day). He didn't study English in school. And he comes from a discriminated caste.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He never complained about all the injustices life did to him. Rather, he would spend all his nights studying. He was upbeat, positive and humble. Any time I saw him, it was with a book. Day after day, he would spend 20 hours studying. And he teamed up with a guy from a totally different ethnicity and equally discriminated. They both shared not a word in common and spoke completely unintelligible languages with no link language.\n" +
                "\u200B\n" +
                "Outside my class. They are classmates of mine who have all drastically climbed the ladders of poverty and are now literally perched at the top.\n" +
                "Not the exception, but the norm.\n" +
                "By the end of his 4 years of study, he got hired into CDAC developing supercomputers earning 200x his father and grown into their Senior Technical staff. But, that is not the amazing part.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The amazing part is that his story is the norm rather than an exception. Another classmate is the 8th son in a family of farmers in a remote village. None of his whole extended family went to high school. Today, he would rank in the top 20% bucket in the US in salaries. He makes in one year what his whole family of 20+ made in a whole lifetime. Let that sink in for a moment.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " I can tell you hundreds of stories from my LinkedIn network of such classmates who are building operating systems, search engines, databases, rockets and supercomputers.  My own paternal grandfather came back as refugee from Burma joining a press as uneducated manual worker. Two generations ago, almost everyone in my large extended family was around poverty line. Now, none of the 200+ are. This is true of almost every urban middle class family in India - two generations ago we were all poor.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "And the kids of various maids (used to be called \"servants\") we had are all well qualified engineers who are traveling the world. The abjectly poor ball pickers in the tennis court are making big bucks here in the east coast and earning well above US average.\n" +
                "Indian Americans are now the most educated & highest earners in the US.\n" +
                "What is a revolution anyway?\n" +
                "Revolution as popularly imagined is the adult version of throwing tantrum. Despite it being glorified by a lot of propaganda machines, it seldom leads to positive outcomes. Let's suppose you are writing a poem and you don't get ahead at all with your words. You will get angry at some point and tear apart the paper. That's what happens in a revolution - society is torn apart when people don't get ahead. On the other hand, if you have gotten your rythm and have finished the first stanza, you will be more motivated and will be less likely to tear apart the paper - even if you know that you have many more stanzas to finish.\n" +

                "The revolutionaries with books in hand and marks in mind\n" +
                "Each one of them is changing their whole community around them. The illiteracy in their whole extended family ends instantly as soon as one of them gets out of the vicious cycle of poverty.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "None of them talked of revolution or system change. None of them ever talked of violence. None of them took shortcuts of alcohol and drugs. None of them whine about their condition. They took positive steps.  All of them are revolutionizing India.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "We are having millions of such new revolutionaries not with the trigger of a gun, but with the keypad and LCD screen. Yes, India's poor people are \"revolting\" and getting impatient. But, with a book in hand and grades in mind.\n" +
                "Wealth is trickling faster than ever\n" +
                "My college experience is a remarkably life changing experience for me, just for the sheer amount of changes I was seeing in my friend's families. That is what gives hope for me about India. Millions of Indians are climbing out of poverty every year. They are transforming whole communities and showing up in aggregate statistics.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Last year, I was at Niagara on a chilly morning. I saw 3 busloads of school kids. I spoke with the kids and they turned out to be from the same city as I was in India. I am quite familiar with the school not too far from my Chennai home. These kids whose parents were poor not too long ago are now traveling the US for a 6th standard school trip!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "And it is not just engineers who are going rich. The wealth is trickling rapidly to the surrounding ecosystems. I will quickly recount the story of a dude in my area - Krishnankutty. He once accosted me at the neighboring temple and started randomly explaining his story. He was a tailor in a poor hamlet 30 km south of Chennai. In the 1980s, he got the urge to buy marginal lands in his region. A few in my family held plenty of lands there and they sold to him, apart from many others. He illustriously started merging them. It so happened that Chennai started building its tech parks in that region. He offered huge plots of contiguous land and he got super rich. He now owns in excess of $60 million (Rs. 350 crores) by helping the tech companies setup their sprawling offices. This erstwhile illiterate tailor now calls himself Dr. Krishnakutty by spreading some of his own wealth around. I see plenty of such real estate & manufacturing millionaires. Plenty of new jobs have been all around that region now.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "This story is not unique to Tamil Nadu but is happening all over India.\n" +
                "Maharashtra: Benz makes history as Aurangabad gets 150 Mercedes cars at one go\n" +
                "Gujarat: Farmers' new mantra: Got cash, get car!\n" +
                "A new person added to the middle class every second\n" +
                "The dark spots below are where middle class is having a sizable growth and these are spread all over India although some parts like UP & Bihar could have more of these spots.\n" +

                "In the next 10 years, India's middle class is projected to grow to about 550 million from about 250 million now. India's middle class population to touch 267 million in 5 yrs That is an addition of 30 million (3 crore) people to the middle class every single year. In other words, we are pulling 1 lakh people out of poverty every single day. That is at a gargantuan scale that no country other than China has done in the whole history of the world. Open your eyes to the revolution, dammit.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Of course, we have a long way to go and we can do way better than what we are doing: How can India become a developed nation? Where are we lagging now?\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Lot of clueless people whine and crib about India being poor. They say we are crawling. I know my one year kid cannot talk, walk or run. But, I know what it was 6 months ago. And with my own eyes I can see the transformation. And with this transformation, I can clearly see its future. And I'm so excited about this child. 20 years ago, we had no hope. Now, we are sending rockets [built by poor kids like my classmates]  to Mars and creating a flurry of startups in the valley. We are creating new roads and new jobs.\n" +
                "We are sending stuff to MARS at bottom basement prices.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " If you are going to complain about my kid and his development without knowing all he has been through, get out of my sight ASAP. Of course, a lot of India's enemies would want our poor to revolt & riot, hampering our growth. But, our poor are not going to take the bite. They are smarter and recognize that their way out is education. And that is why I'm so passionate about education - it is the key to India's future.\n" +
                "Do I believe India is changing? Yes.\n" +
                "Do I think India still has a lot more problems to solve? Yes.\n" +
                "Do I believe we could do the development a lot better and faster? Yes.\n" +

                "Epilogue.\n" +
                "Last week, as I was leaving my parent's home in Chennai, I went to a small temple in a nearby slum. A very poor, old woman known to my parents was selling flowers outside the temple. I had a smalltalk with her and told her about my work. She was talking about her nephew who just got to Boston.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Her future was just about to change. It welled my eyes. I profusely thanked the resident of that temple. India is in a state of revolution. India is changing right in front of my eyes.\n");
