Dharma includes the moral code and lays out the rules & guidelines on how humans can stay in harmony with the world around us. In Hindu tradition, we don't have any name for our religion.

                "There can be many types of dharma (each dharma is basically set of moral codes that don't conflict with each other). For instance, Buddhists have their own dharma - the rules laid by Buddha. Casteist Hindus have their own dharma called the Varnasrama dharma - laid by Manu. Zorastrian Persians have their own dharma - called Daena. Sikhs have their dharma - one laid by Guru Gobind Singh and other gurus of the religion. \n" +

Indian epic of Mahabharata is a perfect example of how Dharma can be one with often counterintuitive and paradoxical things. Hindus don't believe that one can manage this world with a simple set of skeleton rules. Thus, Hindu dharma (in contrast to Buddhist, Jainist and Sikh dharmas) is a very complex one. \n" +

While \"killing\" is immoral in most other religions, Hinduism takes a very pragmatic approach. It is also dharmic for a king to have a spying agency that can often use lying and deception to protect its territory. On the other hand, it is adharmic to not support your parents in their old age, although it is morally ok in other religions. Also it is adharmic to eat without parting your food with animals around you (usually crow, cow and dog - the most common creatures in India).\n");
