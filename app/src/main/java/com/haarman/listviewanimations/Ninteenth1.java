		textView.setText("There is a fundamental misunderstanding underlying the question that humans always prefer pleasure over pain. For many humans, challenge [with the accompanying pain] is more exhilarating than tiny pleasures. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Every woman knows that birthing a child will be painful. However, millions of moms do it every year. A big chunk of them do it happily and voluntarily. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Most entrepreneurs know that startups are inherently risky. But, they do it anyway even if it might mean doing work 20 hours a day and losing all financial stability.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Soldiers deployed in the war front know that they might die any time. They happily serve anyway. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Whistleblowers and activists know that uncovering the truth might get them killed. They seek to uncover the truth anyway. \n" +
						 "People do puzzles, run marathons, do crazy stuff for the Guinness Book, work out hard in the gyms, spend their lifetime at the laboratory, explore the world. They donate their hard earned money to charity and they continue to work long after they have earned enough. They don't do it for pleasure. But, for sheer challenge. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 " This is also why someone would pursue Phd or spend long time in academia even if they know that they could be making more money & fame in finance or elsewhere. They just cannot stand while their internal curious mind is killing them to explore that truth they always want to. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "This is also why someone would give it all up and become an ascetic or an ardent religious person. Think of Buddha, Gandhi and a variety of their followers. They all had a much easier, pleasant alternative in their life. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Unlike what the hardcore Maslow hierarchy followers believe, it is not just the people who are at the top of the pyramid who are motivated by this. Imagine a scenario where some group of outsiders have taken one of the local kids and brutally killed him. Rich and poor both would pick up the pitchforks without thinking much about the rational stuff or their own security. Because, they just cannot stand a world where a young kid is murdered that way. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Fundamentally, a lot of us just cannot just stand not pursuing that truth that we fervently believe and that we want the world to know and practice. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Not just the good. Even the bad things follow the same. When an extremist person attacks an idea or a whole society, he/she is not necessarily thinking about his/her own heaven or earthly benefits. What that person cannot do is stand while the ideas he/she deeply cherishes is being threatened. Nazis could not just stand while the people they deeply hated were so successful. Had they tried to maximize profit, they might have not been so cruel in that case. Same is true of the ISIS terrorists who cannot stand while their faith is supposedly under attack from the outsiders. From Crusades to Communist revolutions it was primarily the same - people had a fundamental urge to either spread their idea or protect their idea - even at the cost of losing all their pleasures or even life. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "We have a goofed way of thinking about incentives and falsely assume that humans are profit maximizers. That leads to bad management practices and bad economic ideas. Humans love challenge and that trumps cash incentives in many cases. Bosses often think they can always buy people's loyalty and productivity by just giving them salaries and bonuses. It doesn't hurt, but they need to do far more than that. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Many people have this itch to do something monumental. Something challenging. Something that they are so troubled to get to know. Something they cannot sleep without. A lot of people have their own internal Mt. Everest that they want to conquer.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "And those people who do climb the Everest and other real or figurative peaks inspire the rest of us to think of the impossible and to achieve things previously thought not to be possible. In short, those climbers help the humanity get its best out. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "It is these people and their uncontrollable itch that is driving the world; not money; not pleasure; not comfort.");
