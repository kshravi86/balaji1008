                "For most of world's economic history, India had the biggest economy in the world. There must be something that made us the world's biggest economy for that long. We weren't always this poor, this ugly, this unorganized, this sloppy or this dirty like we are in 2012. The purpose of this essay is not to gloat/dwell in the past, but to get inspired to move us in the future. It is not to brag that we \"superior\" in any way, but to make Indians understand that fundamentally India  can be rich & clean, how we had lost track in the past 3 centuries and how we can learn from the ancients in the process of rediscovery.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Currently, the knowledge of history is placed the least importance in our schools and that is terrible. We had our lowest point in 19th century, when we had forgotten our entire history, including who Ashoka was, until the Europeans dug & find out. Not coincidentally, that was when we started declining as a nation.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    Indus valley (Land of great planning) - 3000 BCE - We always assume that Indians are poor planners with nasty sanitation. Ironically India was born in Indus Valley as one of the most planned & well organized civilizations. 5000 years ago, we had the world's first known bathrooms, urban sanitation systems, warehouses. The streets were impeccably aligned and there were even a few 2 storey buildings. The cities were elaborately protected and we traded as far as Egypt and Iraq (Mesopotamia). Indus Valley Civilization -\n" +
                "    Sadly, we don't know what happened really to our ancients.\n" +
                "    Takshashila (the great university) - We had one of the first universities around 2500 years ago where two great guys taught - Chanakya (master of strategy) and Panini (grammar dude). For centuries, this remained the main center of Indian learning and was later joined by Nalanda University. It is believed that Mahabharata was first recited here.\n" +
                "    Magadha Dynasty (rise of Indian religions) - These were among the oldest Indian kingdoms that we know well about (from 680 BC). It is from here that Buddhism and Jainism rose. For about 1000 years, ruling Magadha (with its main city Pataliputra) was the most important goal for any king aspiring to rule India. They were among the first creators of democratic systems in the form of Gramakas and had a decentralized system. The dynasty is known for great administration & system.  Some of the earliest kings we know about (Bimbisara and Ajathasathru) came from this dynasty.\n" +
                "    Nanda Empire (one of the first major empires) - They were building empires and started the process of consolidation in India\n" +
                "    King Porus or Purushottama at Hydaspes (the guy who stopped Alexander in 328 BC) - Alexander the great was unstoppable. He won most of the old world. But, near Purushapura (Peshawar) he fought one of the most defining battles - Battle of the Hydaspes. Purshottama ruled a smaller territory and had no support from the 100s of other Indian kings (a sadly consistent characteristic of India), but he was terribly brave. Although Porus was finally defeated in the closely fought battle, Alexander felt he would not be able to continue any more.\n" +
                "    Chandragupta Maurya (the first Indian emperor) - Although, Alexander went back, one person was not happy that an Indian king lost to a random Greek guy. The guy pleaded with a major Indian king - Dhana Nanda to fight Greeks, but had no response. This guy (Chanakya) who was a professor in Takshashila was so angry that he left his cushy job and began king-making. He took an unknown solider - Chandragupta Maurya and molded him into India's greatest warrior. He is widely considered to be the first person to unify India. His book - Arthashastra - is a landmark work on strategy that is still used in India.\n" +
                "    Gupta Age (period of Science & Art): Based in Pataliputra (Patna). This is considered to be the Golden Age for India. Gupta Empire - In just 230 years from about 320-550 AD - these guys built one of the most advanced empires in the world. We had Kalidasa (literature), Aryabhata (math), Varahamihira (astronomer), Vishnu Sharma (the guy who wrote Panchatantra) and Vatsyayana (Kamasutra guy). We had both gold and silver coins with a well established currency/trade system.\n" +
                "    From the iron pillar near Qutub minar (that has not rusted in 1500 years) to Nalanda University to Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh (earlier surviving temples) these guys built some of the greatest works of art. And two of the great Indian kings - Samudragupta & Vikramaditya, belong to this empire.\n" +
                "    Rajendra Chola I (India's Alexander) - 1024 AD - While other Indian kings focused on warring in India, one man had world sized ambitions. He inherited his father's Chola kingdom and set out to build one of the most fantastic empires in South India. He conquered most of south India and Sri Lanka, and subordinated Kandara (Malaysia), Sri Vijaya (Indonesia), Kamboja (Cambodia). He built great temples - one which is a UNESCO world heritage site - Gangaikonda Cholapuram\n" +

                "A country that doesn't know its ancient history is cursed with poor  development. Some of the greatest social growth came when people started  exploring the ancients. Europe pulled itself out of the dark ages of 5th-14th centuries by studying Greek & Roman civilizations (Renaissance), Japanese with Meiji restoration (late 19th century) and to some extent  the modern Indian renaissance came a 150 years ago, as we started to unearth our past.\n" +
