                "In high school, I was bought into an another fad - speed reading. I bought a whole bunch of books on reading faster and faster. It sort of made sense. I assumed that the faster I read, the more information I consumed, the more intelligent I became. In the early days of Wikipedia, I planned to read the entire content. After about 25,000 pages I gave up as I realize it is almost endless. \n" +

                "Just like the fat, I realize that the speed reading is a terrible thing. It fills our minds with way too much crap and clogs our thought process. The modern society makes us think that more is better. We want fast vehicles, fast food, fast access to information and fast reading skills. While we have realized the fast transportation and food comes at a huge cost to the body, we are only now realizing that the fast access to information comes at a huge cost to the mind. \n" +
