                "First, let us assume the steady state - the company will keep making profits at the current rate. This is the easy part. We then add all the future profits, apply time discounting and find out what the company is currently worth. It is very straight forward. The main method used is called the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis... (explained below).\n" +

                "DCF is quite good for very stable companies such as electric power utilities that have little change or competition. For instance, if a company makes $10 million in profits each year consistently and your time value of money (returns you can get from a market portfolio) is 10%, the company would be valued at $61 million. Try this with this calculator. http://www.moneychimp.com/articl...\n" +

Some of the popular ratios P/E (Price by earnings), P/S (Price by sales) and P/B (Price by book value). They show the relative strength of the company against its past and against its competitors.\n" +
                "State of the economy and industry. If you are in a growing economy and growing industry, you can try to bake some of the growth projections into the company assuming that the market is big enough for the competitors to expand without impacting the analyzed company.\n" +
                "Strength of the management & business model. If the management is good & trustable and the business model is strong, you can expect them to move with the market and constantly grow the company.\n" +
