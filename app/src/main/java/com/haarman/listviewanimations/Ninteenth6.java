		textView.setText(     "City building has always been my dream. I spend most of my dream time designing my city.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Principles: \n" +
						 "The city should be self-sufficient when it comes to food & energy.\n" +
						 "The city has to avoid fossil fuels.\n" +
						 "The city has to be about people & dynamism. There has to be room for spontaneity.\n" +
						 "Culture has to be everywhere. A city without culture is a dead city.\n" +
						 "The core emphasis will be the streets - the arteries of a healthy city. Instead of mere transportation, the streets will focus on happiness, connections & sparks (will cover it below).\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Cultural elements: The city would be divided into 100 parts and finer details of each part would be designed by an architect from a different culture. There would be Mayan, Indus valley, Chinese, Gothic, Islamic, Parisian, Tamil, Mali and Egyptian styles among others. Statues and paintings from that culture would decorate the streets of that part. Each part of the city would have a culture of its own and provide a healthy rivalry. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Transportation: The city would have no cars or buses. The city would be built longitudinal with underground trains running end to end (sort of Manhattan shaped). The last-mile transportation will be through bikes (that can be rented for free) and golf-cart sized automated vehicles. These vehicles would be available on-demand through your mobile device. It will drop you at the nearest metro station. You will be metered per usage (less than $0.05/mile - cost of electricity). \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Roads & Streets: The roads in the city - especially in the central parts shall be narrow (no more than 50 feet wide). Big roads split people on the side and weaken the city. Roads close to the water bodies will be replaced with canals. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Walls & painting:\n" +
						 "Given the absence of cars (with just automated vehicles), roads can be used for festivals and cultural stuff. Walls close to the major roads should be reserved for community painting. If you have Chinese new year, paint it all with dragons. If it is Diwali, fill it with lamps. Bring on the dynamism. A community that has a creative room and always on streets keeps crime off the streets  and peeing on the streets.  The painters would be possessive enough to keep their painting area clean & safe ;-)\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Food: Surface area will not be wasted at all. Thus, almost every piece of land - rooftops, roadsides and empty lands should be used for organic farming. The community gardens will be used by the neighbors - providing both fresh produce & community interaction. The cool air from these farms will make air conditioning unnecessary. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Education: The city would have a massive university teaching almost every field of human endeavor. The city would be powered by the intellectual horsepower of this university. Every sidewalk square would be a gathering of intellectuals. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Homes: Homes would be completely configurable nano machines. Thus, I could move the whole wall if necessary or change the color when needed. The furniture would all be integrated. People would spend time \"programming\" physical spaces within their homes. Each home would display the creativity of the inhabitant. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Public spaces: People should have ample space to sit close to the streets and play. With strong glasses for windows, don't worry about children playing ball. If a sculptor needs to build, do it close to the sidewalk. Use the walls to paint. Bring the people out of their homes and TVs. All public places would make it mandatory to switch off cellphones (just like an Opera). If you want to talk on the phone and is a non-emergency, you have to find an indoor place. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Lighting: The street lights would be all over the city, but would be on only when a person is nearby (detected by radio signals from a mobile). This way the city would have less light pollution, the lights would not be worn out too soon & there would be less power usage. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Energy: The city would produce its energy through solar, biomass and nuclear (ideally fusion if we can get there). No fossil fuels can be used by any of the industries. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Water usage: The city should recycle all water (from rainwater to drainage from homes). \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Efficiency: The city would pick stars from those who are highly efficient (in any activity). Efficiency would be a prime sport. Just like moving a ball from one end to an another, people would compete on the best way to do stuff. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Density: The central has to be fairly dense. The transportation systems should force people to be on the streets meeting each other. A city where things are excessively spaced will not provide the spark. There is a reason why people flock to Manhattan, London, Mumbai and other places. \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "Zoning: The central rectangle of the city will be zoned - with commercial, industrial and retail zones. The outer rectangle would be mixed-used with a mix of commercial and residential fixtures. All government facilities will be moved to the corner. There must be green spaces - but not too much. The reason is that too much green space within a city will cause the city to sprawl - putting strain on surrounding ecosystems & forcing alternate transportation (counterintuitive, hah). \n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "The right balance:\n" +
						 "The city should strike the right balance between technology & culture. Technology should be implicit & out of sight. It should not come in the way of people's interactions. No visible power lines or rail tracks. No use of mobile phones in public spaces. Not excessive use of lighting where unnecessary.\n" +
						 "\n" +
						 "In the same way, there has to be a right balance between community & privacy. Inside homes people should have ample creative room to design & be unique. Outside homes there must be stress on the community. Incentives should be there for people to spend enough time doing both I have met President Kalam four times. In those times I have come to understand why he is so highly revered. Here are some of my experiences. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"April 2001: The   first of the meetings came in when we he was a National Security   Adviser and visited our college for inspecting some of the student   projects. Our college had a deep relationship with DRDO - India's   defense research organization and he wanted to apprise himself of some   of the new developments. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"The   night before he was supposed to come, at around 10pm he just came over   in his jeep with no security and thrilled the students doing the  decoration & settings for the following day's event. People were   stunned to see an eminent guy with a massive security threat just   walking like that and asking people what they were working on. He said  he wanted to meet the real hardworking people who were relegated to the  back on the event day. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"There   was a big commotion in the hostel that night as everybody ran to grab   some paper or the other to get his autograph. Then on the event day, he   patiently listened to all our ideas, even though many of our ideas  were  too impractical if I think about it now. He acted as though he was  our buddy, and not the highest ranking scientist in India.  \n" +
			"\n" +
			"\n" +
			"\n" +
			"February 2003: By this time, Kalam had already become India's President. I was in IIT Delhi for a student event. A couple of months before that, I got an award from the Institution of Engineers on a defense related idea and wanted to tell our President that. So, I walked up to Rashtrapathi Bhavan (President's Office) and wrote a poorly written handnote in the front desk saying I want to meet the President for some of the ideas I was working on how to develop India. They thought it was weird and said they will send the note to his secretary. You don't just walk to meet the President of 1.2 billion people. It was crazy, but I was just a stupid teenager who had a more simplistic view of the world. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"Actually,it was my grandfather who moulded me a lot who gave this idea of directly writing to the President. He had a keen sense of people and thought the President Kalam might read it. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"The next day evening as I came back from my competition, my uncle with whom I stayed in Delhi looked very excited. He said the President's office called and they asked if I was free the following day. Free? I would run in the middle of a highway to meet the President of India, revered by a billion people. That was the most positive shocking news I had ever heard. The President wanted to meet some random teenager in response to a poorly handwritten note. My uncle told me not to get my hopes too much and maybe someone in President's office wanted to meet me. But, if I ever get a chance to meet his excellency, I should try to take a photograph with him.  \n" +
			"\n" +
			"\n" +
			"The next day, I took an autorickshaw to the rashtrapathi bhavan and still didn't know that I will meet the President. I got out of the Autorickshaw and told the guard that I was here to meet the President. Looking at me and the autorickshaw he was barely able to contain a laughter. He then called up the office to confirm and let me walk. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"After 30 minutes of security checks, I was outside his office. Then couple of his assistants came and trained me on how to act when I'm with the President. They told me how to eat, how to respond, etc. My heart started to pant. I was totally unprepared as I didn't expect to meet him. I didn't even have a good set of formal shirts for that event. I looked totally out of place and didn't have anyone to ask my silly questions on how to behave. I was alone and afraid. As a teenager, life didn't prepare me for that day. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"Then the moment came. I was asked to enter the President's Office. I expected to see a huge coterie of assistants and a few security guys. Stunned to see that there was none. The President was alone in his desk working. I closed the door and stood. The President offered me a seat and asked me to explain my ideas.\n" +
			"\n" +
			"In the next 30 minutes, I talked about all the various science papers I had written and the President not just put up with that, but kept making notes & comments on my papers. It was like a dream and was tempted to pinch myself to realize what was happening. Within a few minutes he drilled into the ideas and went into the minute details of the papers, while still keeping the talk jovial. He even joked about how the President was forced to wear these formals, while he would have preferred to wear the folded fullsleeve shirts. At the end of 30 minutes, his secretary came in and said it was time for his next appointment. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"So, I stood up, thanked him and went out. Oops, I forgot to take a photograph with him. I then gently asked his secretary, if I can take a photograph with him. The secretary replied that it is not a custom to take a Photograph with visitors in that office and President was to be there at an another event in 1 hour. The President heard that and called for his photographer. I was clumsily dressed and looked awkwardly and entered his office once again. (Give that he is never late for any appointments that 5 extra minutes probably took away his rest time before he went on to meet business leaders at FICCI.)\n" +

			"\n" +
			"After I came out, his secretary asked about the next time I will be in Delhi. I told him that I will be around for independence day (August 15). He just made a note of it and left. This is the greatest day of my little life. I got to chat with my hero for more than half hour. \n" +
			"----\n" +
			"August 12, 2003: I was in Delhi again at my uncle's place. Once again, the President's office called. I was even more shocked this time, as I didn't even write a stupid note this time. I was called once again to meet, remembering the previous conversation. It seems the President wanted to meet a couple of teenagers on the eve of our Independence day. This time it was a shorter meeting at 15 minutes and the President once again put up with my impractical ideas on how to change the nation. \n" +
			"----\n" +
			"\n" +
			"Later, I had seen him a couple of times at Microsoft in 2008 after his Presidential term. He was there for an event and although I didn't get a chance to meet him one on one, it was great to see His Excellency. In one of the events - a dinner hosted by Bill Gates Sr (father of Microsoft founder), Gates Sr remarked that we should call Kalam always a President (in the US, once a President always a President). I agree.\n" +
			"---\n" +
			"A lot of people claim down to earth, but our President was in a different level. He had a an extraordinary memory, patience, attention to details and more importantly kindness. While at office, he had almost turned the massive President's office into a science & social lab, inviting ideas from all over the nation. He was in in his 70s and was past his peak. Even then his mind was relentlessly working on science & language. He seemed to do his work by himself and inspired others to do the same. \n" +
			"\n" +
			"He was a quintessential Gandhi in a scientist robe and the greatest President we had ever had. In a nation where politicians act like pigs looking for the next avenue to rob, he was sitting there building bridges with common people, doing research, writing books and talking science. Our nation was gifted to have him." );
