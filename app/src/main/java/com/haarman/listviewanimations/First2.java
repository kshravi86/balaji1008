                "There was a Chemist who was explaining to a layperson that he discovered the right combination in his 3000th trial. The layperson responded, \"why didn't you do the 3000th trial the first time itself?\" Life is a series of experiments and sometimes it can take a long time to get to the answer. Besides the start of Holocene (11700 ago) produced some dramatic changes in global climate that made things favorable for agriculture. Before that, the ice ages called Riss and Wurm made life hard for humans for 10s of thousands of years & even bare survival was brutally hard. [We are in the most favorite climatic condition possible and that is why scientists are so worried by climatic change that can lead to some what our ancestors faced]\n" +

                "We took tens of thousands of years to settle down (starting from the migration in Africa). After we settled down, we discovered ways to domesticate plants about 12,000 years ago, discovered metals about 8000 years ago and started writing things about 5000 years ago. Each of these steps helped us bring the humans together and build ideas on top of another. Let us look at some of the major events in human history.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Long Answer\n" +
                "Migration from Africa: The modern humans are believed have evolved around 200,000 years ago. Recent African origin of modern humans. For the first 100,000 years we remained there until some unexplained sequence of events started forcing them outward. Then humans started walking and it took multiple generations for them to survive the deserts Africa to reach Europe and Asia, and later the Americas. Imagine walking the Sahara or Arabian desert with no shoes, water cans or camels. Only when we started settling, did we have the time and resources to build something that could be passed on to the future generations. Without that settlement, great ideas would have died with the person or the tribe. Our first major settling down happened around 12000 BC. Sedentism\n" +
                "Low Population: Until about 10000 BCE, world population never exceeded 15 million and mostly was around 1 million. Urban World History The present population of the world is 7 billion and 1 million is comparable to the population of a medium size city. When you have just a couple of million people spread in this big wide world, there is little that humanity could collectively build. Even if we assume that early human being could be as productive as us, their civilization could produce less than 1/1000 of what our society could do.\n" +
                "Life Expectancy: From that point until 20th century, we had a very low life expectancy (about 30 years). Imagine if we all died by the time we reached 30, how much could we learn from our parents and how much can we teach our kids. Given the low life expectancy of early humans, there was not much time to learn and teach. We just started randomly doing whatever we could to survive. Life expectancy\n" +
                "\n" +
                "4. Use of fire: Early humans didn't find a way to use the fire in a controlled way. This means we often lived in the dark (no fire means no lights), cold and scary place. Control of fire by early humans. Only since about 125,000 BP we started using fire in a controlled way and it took a lot of trial and error.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "5. No sophisticated tools and domesticated animals: Early humans used primarily stone tools and until about 50,000 BC these were quite crude. They helped a little bit in hunting, but didn't take us far. We had to wait until 6000 BC to get our first metal - Gold. History of Metals. With metals, we could tackle a lot more elements and do far more tools. We didn't have any animal to help us out. We first started domesticating dogs and later sheep, pig, horse, etc. Each of the domestication waves took 1000s of years of trial and error. Domestication\n" +
                "\n" +
                "6. Civilization allowed us spare time. By 12000 BCE, many groups of humans found habitable regions to grow their tribe. They had found ways ways to domesticate a few plants & animals and had made superior tools. As large groups of humans started gathering and work year-around in the same place, we found ways to share and transmit ideas. Trade was discovered and humans suddenly found spare time to do stuff. Civilization.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Until that point we spent most of our time in survival mode. Once we could crop and store stuff, we had plenty of time for pleasure. That meant that we could start building stuff (for worship and living), organizing into more complex groups and start specializing. Human evolution\n" +
                "\n" +
                "7. Writing began. History of writing It was about 3000 BCE when we actually started putting our ideas into a pictorial form. Until that point, most of the ideas that humans generated would have evaporated. Imagine, if we had no science books. Each generation would have to discover Newton's laws and all other scientific theories by themselves. With writing, we could stand on the shoulders of others.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Then we discovered the wheel about 4000 years ago. This allowed us to travel fast and transfer products and humans between regions. Then the rest is history. In short, we spent a lot of time in a trial-and-error mode to find the right places to live and the right things to eat. Given the short life spans and absence of settlements, ideas could not get transmitted. As we discovered ways to keep us warm and bright at night, got spare time due to agriculture we started putting our brains to a good use.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Innovation/Invention requires a lot of trial and error and the ability to build on previous results. Until a few thousand years ago, these experiments were local and there was little we could learn from others experiments. Thus, a guy in Ethiopia might have been trying to master fire control even 5000 years after a guy in Sweden has already mastered it. There was no easy way to transfer ideas given the lack of wheel (to enable quick movement), writing systems, broadcast communication etc. The population was also too low to improve the odds of experimentation. Lastly, we were too focused on survival to afford us the time to innovate. Agriculture liberated us from the focus on the daily search for food.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, we are constantly discovering about our past and our knowledge of our ancestors is not complete. 100 years ago we didn't know about the magnificent Indus Valley civilization and knew little of Mesopotamia or Incas. New discoveries are constantly pushing back the known history and I would not be surprised if we discover more complex civilizations from 10000 BC that have just been lost due to the passage of time.\n");
